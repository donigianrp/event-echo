    contents: `God I love this team So proud of this defense Whitehead three INT’s Clemons with a clean strip My heart breaks for Aaron. This squad is special and he could’ve taken us to the promise land
        Felt like a Super Bowl game. That was one of the most exciting games I’ve seen in years. This team with a healthy Rodgers is very dangerous, they are Super Bowl contenders.
        What a ride!Seeing Rodgers running onto the field with the flag?To seeing that sack?And taken off the field?To rallying that win!!What a team!So happy y’all got that win!!👏🏻
        Defense is insane. Offense is good. But we're short of a QB. My heart is shattered
        I like this dude. As a pat fan bill gives us nothing. This dude just shoots it straight and that's that. Like it or leave it. I can respect it
        One of the best team wins I've ever seen. Ik it's not looking good for Rodgers and all us fans know this too well but maybe we get one last miracle and he's able to return.
        One of the craziest games I’ve ever seen. Of course we all want Aaron to return quickly. The Jets came together and made major plays. Get better Aaron!!!
        As a Life Long Jets fan- I wish Zach the best of luck on this new opportunity. Most the real fans here support you. Get that confidence kid, you have what it takes. Now let’s install some better passes and protections for my guy!
        I am so sorry to read that Aaron was injured last night. I am a Packer fan and I appreciate what he did for our team. I pray it is a minor injury. I have had many bad breaks in life where people celebrated my struggle. Im not made like that. I believe the Jets will have a great year hopefully with Aaron. 🙏🏽☝🏽👊🏽🇺🇸
        I can't even imagine how Roger's got hurt. It was the most gentle takedown I've ever seen.
        Prayers up for Aaron Rodgers. He was so ready and excited to lead this team, I’m heartbroken as a fan and I’m heart broken for him.
        Lions Fan here. Big time respect to Coach Saleh! Considering events, this interview proves the Coach you have for the Jets. Best of luck Jets, my heart sank for ya's when Rodgers went down. Hated him as a Packer, Loved the football player!
        One of the best defensive performances ive seen
        Wow what a comeback from behind, congratulations New York Jet what a game. Hope Aaron Roger will be alright.
        Heart-breaking for us Jet fans. Seems like we'll never get that break.
        I’m a packers fan I was rooting for Rodgers & the jets this year & was hyped to see him play tonight & succeed with the jets but never thought he was going to get injured 1st drive, prayers to Rodgers 🙏🏽
        Jets came together and made some amazing major plays, My heart goes to A-ROD Also , I’m praying for the best for him Get well soon #8 But they won this for Rodgers and I couldn’t be happier for a team that has went through so much personally
        Whitehead is the man with those 3 INT's and sending prayers to Aaron 🙏🙏🙏🙏 love this team ❤️
        This game plan wasn’t designed for Zach but hopefully we get another QB in the room. The team and coaching staff did an amazing job last night.
        Wow I mean wow, I can’t even imagine what Rodgers is feeling like. This team is 100% ready to win a SB and this happens
        The most emotional roller-coaster game I've watched
        Great job rallying the men! Love the dub and impressive performances from multiple guys ✈️
        Robert Saleh is a good head coach. The offensive play caller is also very good.
        Shout out to my boy coach Saleh!!!! ALL GAS NO BRAKES!!!!!! LET'S GO JETS!!!!!!
        When Aaron went down to this moment was the result of coaching - look into this man's eyes, and you can see that he's emotional intelligent and a savage.
        There is no way Aaron rodgers ends his career with injuries… dude is still soo talented and now that he has a legit defense of all things an injury for the 2nd year in a row will not allow him to play.
        Sometimes this is where great things happen. Wilson was drafted probably earlier than he should have and didn't seem to mature. Now he he's learned from Rodgers and has to play savior instead of being given the unquestioned keys. I'm an Eagles fan, but I've always felt for Jets fans who've hung in there year after year of disappointment. Jets deserve a winning team.
        O-Line just has to give Zach time. The D and run game will keep jets in all the games just like last year.
        It was such a dramatic ride win! What an entertaining game like a movie!! He is a great coach, a little bit like a copycat of MCDC when he said, " I didn't learn anything". I love both HCs. MCDC looks 100% authentic and transparent while RS is just a little less... he's a bit like a politician. Jets got overhyped too much before this season which seems to affect the team negatively. Very unfortunate that AR got injured from the very beginning. This is a very rare case. But the old wisdom said "Don't get too overjoyed. It will vanish and the darkness will come soon". It's a cycle of life. NFL is nothing different. I do hope Jets deal with their situation with wisdom and grit. Bring JAMEIS WINSTON! He deserves to be a starter.
        Ravens fan here but this is my takeaway for Jets fans. This is Zach Wilson's best chance to prove himself as a starting QB. This will probably the best locker room he will ever lead as a starter for an entire season for the rest of his career...IF he ends up playing like garbage this season. However it doesnt have to be that way...Aaron Rodgers is still in the building to watch film and learn the game from, he still has a ton of great offensive weapons aquired in the offseason, and the defence is probably top 5 in the league. Now is his best chance to bounce back and prove his 1st round value. The window of opportunity is NOW.
        WHEW! Let’s go Jets! Defense saved us…
        We may have just witnessed Aaron’s last play in the league. Truly sad for the game.
        Look it’s not what we expected, but this team showed they don’t quit and they showed why we have so much confidence. Great Team win and effort. All the way around
        PERFECTOR - To rally like that against the Bills, makes a SERIOUS STATEMENT. The Jets have established themselves as one of the most FEARED teams in the AFC. It was those throwback uniforms that gave them the edge 😁
        Not even a fan but yall did that🫡🫡 crazy team win! Had me yelling loud af😂 and im a eagles fan
        Great game. Hopefully the team does well this year without Aaron
        I’m a DIE HARD RAIDERS FAN & I personally think the raiders Vs chargers game in 2021 going into OT & raiders winning was the CRAZIEST/BEST game Ive ever seen in my life, BUT this game is a CLOSE 2nd ! LIKE WTF, Aaron runs out with the American flag it’s big debut, PRIMETIME, throws a nice pass & then 3 plays later he goes down.. come in Zach Wilson & WOW, that mofo deserves a spot in the NFL. This game wasn’t even high scoring & it was STILL INSANE. GREAT JOB JETS FANS. 9/11 NEVER FORGET.
        i’m sad for this jets team and for aaron. as a cowboys fan he always owned us but id never wish this on him. sad we were robbed of the week 2 matchup we were anticipating 😞
        We need to give a SHOUT OUT to special teams! Punter did really good as well as gunners. Kicker made his kicks and extra points and Punt Return catches and return was 🥶
        Really praying the mri he gets tomorrow doesn’t shows Aaron Rodgers tore his Achilles. Not a jets fan but i have love and respect for all players and teams and don’t want to see a legend like A Rod go down after 4 snaps into an extremely hyped season. The jets have all the pieces and just needed a qb.. its Truly sad.. if you’re reading this plz say a prayer for him..
        My heart is with you giving Tom Brady anything he wants to get you this ring. Don’t be stubborn and miss 2 rings like little Kyle 💯
        What a game!!! Letssss Gooooo JETS!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🛩️🛩️🛩️🛩️🛩️
        Question from reporters: did Micheal Clemons meanness cause that fumble or was it fundamental tackling? Robert Saleh: Pure meanness. 😐 Go Jets! Way to win an emotional roller-coaster of a game. From intro, injuries, turnovers, doinked field goals to punt returns! What a game.
        Great team win, grit and valor
        Much respect for you Aaron love how you play
        Let’s Get Arron up in the Booth and on the Headset … Leading Zach from a bird’s eye view… Zach is a Quarterback who just needs guidance and confidence … short completions can help his confidence and Rodgers and Hacket can provide a guidance… We won Jets fans … embrace the win and have faith in JD … Let’s Go JETS!!!
        Great defense. Offensive coordinator called good plays for Wilson.
        No matter how you slice it.....the Jets can never get out of their own way.
        Falcons fan here. Rodgers is my Favorite QB hope he gets well soon! I wish him and the jets the best!
        49er fan here, Congrats jets nation ima fan of coach saleh and im so pumped for u guys.
        Shoutout Zach Wilson. Raider fan but watching him be able to come in and win VS the bills was huge and proud fr
        I wish the bills coach had half the passion this man has.
        This is the same team that was a win away from the playoffs last season, Rodgers going down is awful but nothing changes. We just need competence on offense and we can hang with anyone
        FROM A GREEN BAY LOSS 🐻🏈!!!.. THIS MADE ME SMILE CONGRATULATIONS 👏🏾🎉 NYC ✈️ FROM CHICAGO 🐻🏈
        Watching saleh light up all preseason talking about Aaron you can see it this one really hurts… Zach PLEASE hold it down for us.
        This Jets defense is real but expectations took a major hit without Rodgers.
        This is the most important win of the year
        In the first quarter Jets fans thought their season was already over and at the end screaming in glory 😂
        I don’t think it’s setting in yet how good a chance we had at a Super Bowl this year. This team was truly beautiful. Aaron was the true leader and missing piece and they looked at him like like the older brother. We are truly cursed as jets and I wish someone could just lift this curse off us for just this one year but it’s just not possible.This team could of been Super Bowl champs/would have been in my eyes. I’ve been a jets fan for over 30 years. I’ve seen jets teams come and go and this was the greatest jets team I’ve ever seen in all those years. I would have loved to seen Aaron be the QB that wins it for us out of any QB. Would have been absolutely perfect. Heartbreaking for all my Jets fans. Maybe we can call Brady see what he thinks. Tbh for him to come out of retirement and win one with the jets would set a bar so high i don’t think a QB could do that for another 1000 years if the games even around still by then. Truly would be a GOD lol this all coming from a jets fan…..we’re desperate lol
        Calf injuries are tricky to deal with especially at his age, and this is the worst possible outcome when a calf injury isn’t fully healed.
        As Kansas City fan im happy to see Bengals Bills loose too in even more horrible fashion 😭
        Good to have a real punt returner .for a change
        It's a cursed franchise. As a life long Jets fan. This fanbase, this city, this team always finds a way to believe year after year after year after year BUT it has never failed... that this is a cursed franchise. Here is to a miricale for Aaron.
        My heart is broken. Ugh! 😭😭😭😭
        This happening to us Jets fans ultimate gut punch .. aint nothing new for us .. All we could do this rally and salvage this season to at least a playoff season, defense and weapons we have are too talented but it all depends what Zach can do ! That Will determine what the Jets can accomplish..
        Wow. As a Packers fan and a Rodgers fan, all I can say is I was hoping your O-line was better than ours last year, because that's all he needed to succeed. What a shame.
        JETS fan here, it's just not a big surprise that something had to go catastrophically wrong at some point. Earlier than I thought, but - season over.
        Gutty win go jets 🔥
        So happy for Zach! His upside is high.❤
        Zach Wilson better make the most of this opportunity. If he's decent - good the jets have a chance every week.
        As a BROWNS fan ! I was so so excited to see the JETS this season I feel so bad for AR8 and jets fans smh I will be rooting for you all
        We need sturdy tackles, Duane was a warrior last year.
        Good game your team played the better football 🏈
        Great win! Still hurts tho 😔
        Line couldn't even give that HOF QB a series. Better get a half dozen more QB's you're going to need them. Dang man that defense.
        Well I Guess We Dont Have A Crutch Anymore ...For Awhile?....Gotta Keep Jet Going Forward....Lets Go Jets!
        I can't believe Aa-ron is dead. He will be missed!
        Let's all take time to reflect. No hot takes. Let's see how things develop on short week. We can't say for sure until more medical comes in.
        **** Rodgers, jets fans: please root for Zac! He's a good kid!
        Best defense in NFL
        I hope the Jets brass reads my post. Heading into this season I posted many times the weakness with this plan was the lack of a competent back up QB. Couldn't imagine it would come to be on the 4th play of the game. So now what? You've assembled a great roster but you find yourselves.... we find ourselves.... in exactly the same situation as last year. Never should've let Mike White leave the team. Are we really going to entrust this season to Zak Wilson again? Didn't you learn anything from last year? Unforgivable to not have a competent back up QB. Even avg QB play would be a vast improvement. So now what's the damn plan? This was all too predictable!
        It couldn’t have happened to a better person
        Non of it matters if Rodgers tore his achilles. We already knew the defense was top notch. This team really had all the pieces.
        Celebrate now but Dallas is next. Our offense gonna need to find a way to put up 20 every game. If we can our defense will do the rest
        I new this was going to happen i blame the jets organization for getting a veteran getting ready to retire.The haunting of Vinnie Testaverde remember jets fans
        As a Bills fan - I'm sorry for the Achilles injury & that sucks for Jets fans. As for us Bills fans - McDermott & Dorsey need to go. Allen forced some passes tonight, but when your OC calls horrible plays sometimes you have to force things. Inept coaching cost them this game & there is no excuse for it. McD is now sitting on the hot seat.
        J - E - T - S JETS JETS JETS, WE ARE NEW JERSEY, WE ARE NEW YORK..!!
        Here in WI, wishing Aaron the best!
        Legendary game. Congrats, Jets. Let the "Fire Joe Douglas" chants begin.
        The superbowl hope is dead but I truly hope this is the season we get playoffs.
        Aron has to come out and coach up The young kid.... Aron is cerebral and he can influence Wilson into real growth...
        Awesome defense. They'll make the playoffs without Rodgers. The D is that good.
        Career stats as a Jet, 0-1 passes completed. Like Moonlight Graham's half an inning in Field of Dreams.
        We need to sign Carson Wentz asap.
        This defense will grow frustrated when the offense is only scoring 10 points and Zach is throwing 2+ INTs every game and leading the League in 3-and-outs. Sauce already looked and played deflated.
        Ppl calling Zach wilson bad but lets be honest, whens the last time Jets developed a qb? Alot of teams out there unable to develop qbs and always trying to draft their "Savior" 😂
        Dallas is going to snatch them. Smash on site.
        The situation regarding the turf conditions at MetLife should really, REALLY be reevaluated because how many more people have to have their careers and personal health jeopardized by this clearly insufficient playing surface? If I’m a player in New York, I’m going to the NFLPA, and the NFL and pushing for some serious change. This clearly is not okay.
        Go Jets!
        Whew you're gonna be alright baby ❤❤ yea!!! GO Jets❤❤❤`,

    contents: `As a Cowboys fan, I feel bad for this guy. For four plays last week, he was full of hope and optimistic. And now it's 17 weeks of chaos and misery.
        this wasn't all on ZW, that offensive line today was just HORRIFIC on all levels. gotta rebound for next week, DALLAS IS LEGIT.
        I'm happy for Zach. He deserves this opportunity. Aaron was right when he said he'd pass the baton to Zach and Zach would have 20 years of qb dominance. It just happened sooner than expected.
        They didn’t look bad in the first half. I think the big problem was that the defense was on the field way to much and they had way to many people wide open the main reason why Lamb had 150. The defense didn’t really put a lot of pressure on Prescott he had a lot of time to throw. Zach Wilson learned something today from the first half he learned how to slide properly. The running game was having a really difficult time today with Parsons pressures.
        You can tell Zach grew up a lot, he finally realizes how hard it really is to be a pro.
        I’m actually not too upset with Zach’s performance tonight. He’s playing the way I’d hope he would last season. He had the right idea for the most part but couldn’t deliver at times. They were just outplayed by a better team. I almost got the feeling like the Jets checked out; I didn’t feel the momentum.
        Good game NY. It’s good to see a lot of New York fans that have class. Hope ZW figures it out.
        Dallas could win 15-16 games this year Parsons is generationally great and versatile
        Jets season is up in flames 🔥
        o line and defense shit the bed with this one and run games was booty. i was happy to see zach finally run a couple times today its baby steps guys, baby steps, not everygame is going to be beautiful this year. we just have to hope zach continues to grow and not go backwards
        This is NOT ALL ZW fault! Our o line was atrocious our d line looked flat and our secondary was non existent! The penalties were terrible timing that killed us time and time again! Thank God it's only week 2! We can learn from this!!! Pats up next JETUP!!!
        Not getting off the field on third down has plagued this team for years
        It's tough to win without a QB.
        Well it’s just good Hackett immediately recognized Brown’s dire need for help with Parsons and adjusted accordingly 🤣
        We have playmakers on offense. Hopefully we improvise and build the offense around them. My only concern is sometimes when the coaches say players are playing good its not true. If you call 3 int ( 2 weeks in a row Int right into the defense chest), giving up 30 points and have an experience inexperienced QB rattled is not good. You have Brown and Tomlinson playing bad and wasn't substitute. No adjustments were made. The defense is playing alot of zone than man to man. Furthermore, the defense line has a Deep rotation with only 1 sack fir this game but some reason they were tired and the QB is stated he did good with a tired defensive. Its only game 2 and I hope it gets better. I di6nt blame anyone the team didn't look good.
        Besides throwing the 3 picks late, Zach did about a good a job as anyone with that putrid O-line. Bekton isn’t the same guy anymore and Duane Brown is another Sr. Citizen who cost us #8 for the year…
        Down by 1 score out of half time we were in it against a really good football team without our QB guys need to play better onto NE JetUp✈️✈️
        The Jets are who we thought they were.
        Zach Wilson was not the problem today. At the time of the INTs the game was already over. You can put any QB behind the O-Line and he would have problems. The Cowboys D-Line was so much better.
        Awesome Coach I hope he stay with jets fir a long time
        As a cowboys fan i like the jets head coach only other coach I actually pull for
        Zach was under fire Coach is right anything over 3rd and 5 that pass rush is absolutely frightening... Having said all that I still make a call to the Vikings to inquire about Cousins...
        Didn’t expect to win this one, was hoping, but I thought Zach did better, almost had 2 TD’s to Wilson.
        Vs a playoff caliber team we're only able to stick in their for about a half of football. The season's long but we have a ways to go ✈️
        Dallas is a monster team. Jets need to figure it out asap. It happened, they're not 0-2 so that's good
        That offensive line is horrifying. Pressured 70 times,and both your backs under 20 yards.
        Vikings fan here and I feel bad for Dalvin Cook because he didn’t get at least one touchdown. I still believe dalvin will get you guys a bit far (at least in the run game)
        O-line again was almost non-existent. If they gave ZW some time he could make plays and #76 can't even get out of his own way.
        ZW was straight up good in the 1st half. Defense was straight up bad. Like yea they were on the field all half but it was their ownf ault. Them and truly puke worthy reffing. Unfortunately, 3 and out to start half 2. BT that and the cook fumble, that was a wrap. Not to mention, my God the OL got eaten alive. It happens, Dallas just played that elite. The thing is to not consistently play like this. This game was on the D and OL, the two units that carried game 1. ZW in the 2nd half needs to find or throw open guys enough to get at least 10 points. But anyone blaming ZW over the D, Ol or 1st half atrocious reffing is out to lunch. Dude was exciting to watch all first half, he belongs.
        jets will be fine guys calm down😂 they played against a really good defense that has been together for 3 years now. you guys have a new unit they will build chemistry over time playing with each other. zach played well you just can’t block micah parsons you have to double team him and when you do the other front 7 can rush very efficiently too. on the back end they have really good corners with diggs and gilmore. it’s a long season they will be okay!
        Parsons was eating up that oline. Why the hell was brown 1-1 with him??
        Why is no one asking about those FOUR carries from Hall? He's the one who can break through a stacked box
        All the people blaming the o line and giving Zach a pass, pleease! Zach is trash! Him being under center allows all defenses to pin their ears back and go to work. Scared little man, you can smell the fear in his eyes. Coach Bob can't wish him into a qb1
        The pace Dallas played at was to fast for the Jets. Sauce wasn't good for the 2nd straight week and the pass rush was invisible plus you can't run the ball your done.
        It ain't Zack. It is lack of desire or basic effort of offensive line. For 3 years now. I saw most of 2nd quarter through the interceptions I knew would happen, out of desperation. I seen Roger's do the same. Zack was your run game. He got you 2 first downs. I would say a couple of 3 and outs were all runs going nowhere. That is on coordinator playing not to lose. Defense had no answers. Dallas took the gas off some. Flat as a team. Roger's may have gotten hurt this game, if not hurt last week.
        Yeah the one pick I kinda think zach didn’t read it and just throw it so so hard missed the man but before this when we were in the game zach made some great throws and nearly had wilson open got tippled as he was unloading but this Dallas team are way way better than I thought defence and offensively wow but guys zach was least making reads changing adjusting but delvin cook is looking like another bell man he doesn’t run fast just thinks if he looks and moves slightly he will get passed no chance but got to give him time I guess but he looks a dud at the min
        We got way to many skilled players not to have a better game plan spread the ball around play no huddle zach is bettering seems better when he doesn't have to think but just ball... JETUP JETS NATION 🛫 ✈️
        Well he’s got you 70 points in two games minus the defense scoring
        good thing is we have built this team literally from all postions elite, now just left for that final pieace of the puzzel O-line. its better then 3 years ago, where we did not know what to fix, because everything needed to be fixed, we are way past that, just need to fix the o-Line now. and we will be in the superbowl.
        They been trying to improve for over 2 years now with Zach Wilson and their still talking about needing to improve. Zach Wilson just sucks bro
        1st round draft pick not even dressing for the 2nd game of the season is troublesome. Yes the draft choice we wanted at O line was taken.... but now we have too many D line pass rushes. Perhaps make a trade for an O line player? I dont know... I dont get paid to make these decisions.... but throughout the spring I made many posts describing the problem with the Aaron Rodgers signing.... and that was our backup QB was still Zak Wilson. So now we are dealing with exactly the same poor QB play we suffered through last year.
        I don’t think he’s seeing anything… just like Wilson can’t see the field
        Listening to SNY Willie Bart & the crew broke it down to a fine powder...I agree as hard as i have been on Zack in the past ( an rightfully so)..today was not all on him at all...the fact is the Kid was kinda handcuffed by the OC with all the vanilla play calling..they did not do enough to help Zack out...also the coaches completely abandoned the run.. they did not use their weapons against Dallas the way Dallas was using theirs weapons against us. The coaches did not have a good game plane and did not the right adjustments at the half in my opinion. Side note: Our Left tackle is getting beat over and over again..he does not look good so far. Got to shake this one off..and get ready for New England..a must win if were serious about this season. The Jets have to make some real adjustments ASAP in the offense because Bill Belichick is going to copy what Dallas did to us with a few more wrinkles to confuse Zack.
        we get to keep our 1st rounder because rodgers wont play 65% of the snaps, we need to make the most of it, and raft an elite oi-line or trade down, and get 2 o-lines. lets start tippman, and get him going.
        I guess we can write off this season.
        our O-line was awful. We have a poor-ass line, and ONLY one dangerous receiver. We need at least two good OTs, and one other Wilson-like receiver. We had ALL off season to dress these things, but instead Douglas chose to live in denial.
        Our championship defense didn’t look like a championship defense….not even a little bit!
        Mekhi Becton was good from what I saw 👀 Micah Parsons was a complete monster, like the squid alien that fills holes on the surface of the spaceship, and is ready to kill you. 😂 But when he ran into Mekhi Becton, it took him out for a quarter and a half. Pay attention!!!
        I didnt think the defence were that good.... missed a lot of tackles by just diving in and letting Dallas convert seemingly every 3rd down is so frustrating. Sauce had a poor game too. He should've stopped Dallas' first TD and then the dropped interception for a certain TD 🤷🏻‍♂️ Offensive line is woeful. Bechton, flase starts and holding, Duane Brown - Parsons went through him like dihorrea! They played in a way to not get Wilson overwhelmed. In the end they lost by 20 points, so let the kid play, what does it matter. Have to beat NE next week otherwise the hype of this team will be GONE.
        Wison essentially took himself out of the conversation for 2023 MVP
        Sauce Gardner needs to reevaluate his life.
        I’m so glad Da Boyz took that smirk off his face #DC4L
        Good game jets Zach was ok today the defense gave up a lot of points
        We got out coached very sad they always knew what we were gonna do. There were no surprises or going for it on 4th. Very predictable play call and didn’t let Zac get to his full potential shame on salah it was way to obvious on what we were doing and we’re gonna do. If this team is gonna b successful we can’t b out coached and take risk and no lane play calling
        New QB new o line !!! That’s it
        And to think the Jets chose Zach Wilson over Micah Parsons!
        Wilson threw a pick to a guy literally 10 feet in front of him.
        Jets' fans can take comfort in that they're better than the Giants. It's not much, but it's something.
        this is normal jets football ,got lucky last week
        Zach played well, rest of the team didn’t today
        The reason Dallas stacks the box is BECAUSE they know Zach can’t throw the ball. Take the run game out of the equation and make Zach throw. The offense was TERRIBLE can’t blame the D for everything. How many 3 and outs did the offense have????
        Awww the confidence left his body when Aaron rodgers went down. He has no confidence in his guys now and it shows.
        Defense can't start playing defense when a team gets in the Red Zone! Tighten up D!
        Send Dallas some picks for Trey Lance.
        This team is atrocious. Completely inept. Coaching down. Here we go again. If Rodgers rushes back to play with this bum O line he will end up in traction. Same crap every year.
        Can the refs try to hide it just a little. With Rodgers I would have liked to see how many calls we would have got
        Cowboys fan here, STFU Jets fans…your defense held Buffalo to 16 pts. Why you hating’?? Support your team bruh! Cowboys are buzzsaw and has nothing to wit your team. You have solid team. Just gel ya’ll be alright.
        Pocket presence and awareness is much better for ZW.
        Parsons was on they ass today !!!! That first rush showed it all ! Wilson isn’t the answer period they are just narrowing time & they know it . Offensive line was also garbage !!! Can’t believe that’s the same O line that’s gonna protect Aaron
        Better get used to this fellas because the Offensive line was horrible last year and we didn't address it in the offseason.
        Can we pick up a pretty decent qb and teach him the play book just in case.
        WHAT OUR OFFENSIVE GAME WAS TERRIBLE SALAH
        Time of possession was a killer and no run game! Teams are going to make Zach beat them through the air. Three int's didn't help either. They did have their chances. Pats will not be easy.
        Sauce has not been the same boss this year. Sophomore slump? Jets were bad on both sides of the ball. So much for a championship defense and asking ZW to manage the game by handing the ball off to Hall and Cook.
        Where is our 1st round impact pick Will McDonald?
        Yes the O line was bad but the coaching? Omg. Thoroughly out-coached AGAIN. All you need to know is last year with 4 weeks left this team was beaten time and again by bonehead plays and being outworked. The seattle game displayed the coaching styles of two very different people. Btw i hope they do stick with Zach because it will all but ensure Saleh is gone along with these sorry-ass coaches who cant seem to get their guys ready to go in any meaningful games. Breece got 4 touches? 😂 penalties from virtually everyone in tough situations? Did the rookie mcdonald even play? Also, zach cant seem to start any drives without throwing at least 2 incompletions in a row…winning formula right there. Finally, people can ‘love’ joe douglas all they want, he had an entire off-season to improve the offensive line and this is what they put out there…its the reason your starting QB is dragging his leg around right now. 🤬 i guess as long as the owner wears a giant iced out chain and doesnt pay for real grass on the field, its all good. Jets-fans should be up in arms and not positive about the reality; no one in this organization has any idea of what it takes to win, and it shows.
        D law said put the league on notice Dallas is for real this year
        Zach is not the guy going forward, I really hope I'm wrong. Jets fan since the start of this team. When or if at will ever happen for us..
        You guys will bounce back...your stacked its just the Cowboys D reminds me of the 2001 Ravens D...Micah Parsons is unstoppable.Hope Rodgers comes back healthy next year...cant blame your Qb but you can blame the OL
        Not the game I saw!!!😳🥺 Sorry coach!
        If they had any other QB they would have won this game. Zac isn’t an NFL QB, there isn’t a single team in the league that would even have him as their backup. I like the kid too… but he’s an XFL QB.
        What are we going to do about this o line?
        as soon as zach takes the field its a jets loss...jets players look deflated even before the first snap
        Zach was fine. What’s he supposed to do when nobody else was helping him? Drops, poor protection, no run game and barely having the ball because the D can’t get the ball back.
        It’s good coach your played hard 😂 need to run with B Hall
        You don’t have Micah Parsons. That is the problem
        Here’s the obvious!! The JETS were out-coached—AGAIN!! No adjustments. DALLAS screen game and drag route the hell out of us! The JETS offensive line is absolutely terrible!!!! Duane Brown needs to be benched!! Disappointed that Hackett didn't employ Dallas’s gameplan for Zachary
        Get 'em next time, Coach!
        So...... you still want to roll with Zach??? 😂😂😂 Why waste the entire season with all of this talent? Please at least TRY to get a QB. Zach Wilson looks like a boy playing amongst men. I know Dallas has a really good pass rush and defense but c'mon... One of the interceptions Zach threw there wasn't even a Jets player anywhere around. He had 3 ints..... with a rating of 38.1...... And people are saying it wasn't his fault??? Did they watch the game?
        Need OL help fast... #76 couldn’t block a D 3 college DE or LB . Pitiful ! No game plan either! Jets be lucky to win another game before the BYE gonna be a Long Month!
        All gassed no breaks
        Time to take Duane brown out, move becton to LT, move AVT to RT and put tippman in at RG
        Get rid of the Online and we be 2-15 that’s some improvement
        I BET KC WOULD UTILIZE HARDMAN
        O Line is TERRIBLE, Aaron Rodgers would've lost today, Duane Brown should Retire and the Defense played soft with ZERO ADJUSTMENTS made the whole game, simply out coached from start to finish.
        The jets treat Zack Wilson like he is a rookie let him throw the ball four wide and one running back open the box
        I’m a BYU fan so I’ve been interested in Jets the last couple of years. The Jets need to bring in a proven veteran Quarterback to put some pressure on ZW. ZW needs to step up and not throw the stupid INTs or Jets need to go a different route. This Jets team is to good not to have decent Quarterback play and ZW is not cutting it at the NFL level unfortunately.
        My coach looks defeated dammm
        RUN THE FUNKING BALL!!! The Jets lost this game because of bad coaching. 1. Went away from the run and put the game in Zachs hands. Real Smart???!! 2. No defensive adjustments were made for Lamb. 3. No game plan for helping the O-line block Parsons.
        One question I was waiting to be asked was. So you've got a young qb who's struggling and weak offensive line why are you calling empty backfield plays? Why are you putting struggling offensive line men in situations that they need to block Mica Parsons one on one?`,

    Looking forward to the off season, the best season for the jets!!!!!!
    He is delusional if he thinks he's not going to lose this locker room soon!
    Gotta give this guy credit. He definitely knows how to answer the questions and keep a level head.
    Liked having him as a coach. Good luck in your next destination Salah
    “Zach is fine” ONG YOU ARE INSANE ! just wait until dolphins score 100 points on us
    just embarrassing. really deflating after all this offseason excitement. can only imagine how it feels for the team. never gonna stop being a jets fan and we all have been here before but man this is just so disappointing. no idea if i can watch this all season. go jets
    This coach socks. This team socks. This quarterback socks. Enough said.
    They can’t play ZW on egg shells to avoid mistakes; ironically, that makes him think too much and make more mistakes and have very bad stats. They’ll have to let him throw the ball and risk making mistakes.
    Biggest injustice is NFL history is that San Fran got 2 third round picks when we hired this in over his head DC. We needed to get Mike McDaniel from San Fran instead.
    Since everyone knows we run on every first down, can we at least put two RBs in the backfield, so at least the 11 men in the box will not know which RB is getting the handoff. With just 1 RB where the ball is going is so obvious
    " It's still early in the season " " Zach gives us the best chance to win"... It becomes impossible to support this team when you hear this. I really like Zach & I wanted him to succeed but it just doesn't work. This situation doesn't help him or the team. They can't believe things will change by sticking to this plan. It's impossible. Of course they will lose their locker room. I just don't get why they are not trying something else.
    When i listen to Saleh talk I hear a guy, that while he isn't glad that Farve got hurt, he is relieved that he basically has zero pressure now that he has Zach as his "only" option. He sounds like a guy who is just glad to have the expectations off his back.
    "Zach Wilson gives us the best chance to win." ??? His QB rating and completion % is worse than last season and I didn't think that could be possible. 🤦‍♂️
    If this coach thinks Zach Wilson is their guy, after MULTIPLE changes and games here, he’s gonna be looking for a new job. Don’t let the door hit behind ya
    "Has Zach showed you enough to keep him as your starter" "Yea he's fine" Ok man.. its your a*s at the end of the day
    Zach has had three years now and the game is not slowing down for him , physically he can play on the NFL mentally he’s at a roadblock and he’s been there a while. He can’t make the decisions fast enough at an NFL level they need to go out and get Carson Wentz or somebody who can move the ball. The last two games were winnable games at halftime. If they had somebody you could play halfway decent. They may have won one or both. another important issue is he’s a very unpopular player in the locker room. When he’s on the sidelines after he makes mistakes, the camera always shows him with his head down sulking he’s never talking to the coaches, other players trying to work through it
    Don't lose your job by being stubborn with keeping Zac as your Starter, it's either the starting QB or the HC, one of them goes first and it's the HC's job to evaluate talent and make the right decision. You're losing the fan base. More accomplished Free Agent QBs are out there you can pick up while Zac continues to grow behind the scenes, remember Zac wasn't supposed to be the Starter this yr but learn from a Vet. Bring in a QB to bring optimism to the fan base who had high hopes going into the season.
    I feel so bad for this man he's such a good coach and he's trying so hard not to say is quarterback is dog shit
    This is insanity!! 🤣🤣
    Bench Zac , we need a Quarterback 🗣️
    I just can’t get over how we keep missing on these first round qb’s. Like why couldn’t Allen or Tua fall in our laps!? 2nd overall pick and this kid doesn’t even deserve to be a backup Qb in the league
    Bring in 2 QB vets into the room this week and let’s see who wins the job
    Should have signed Mike White as the backup ... a no brainer. He had the whole locker room on his side, Zak has no one in the locker room, sheesh
    Zack Wilson couldn't hit water if he fell out a freaking boat!
    Has to be so frustrating for players in locker room when you know the only way you can win is to hold the opposing team to single digits.
    Play calling needs to stop being so predictable, why are the commentators telling the audience what’s about to happen before it does? How do they know we never pass on 1st down? Zach Wilson needs more than 0.5s to identify an ideal target, and if he’s given more time those receivers are going to be able to get more than 10 yards away from the line and we can actually press the field! I believe in you guys like always.
    Sticking behind Zach is going to be his downfall, eventually people are going to want to see an offense that isn’t hampered by qb play and running Zach out there week after week is going to upset people
    Also, the Jets went into this whole Aaron Rodgers plan with no flexibility. They went out and got his coordinator. All his players under the assumption that he’d never get injured. The whole idea was too rigid. They didn’t have a Plan B or Plan c . And zachs back up is Tim Boyle, and if you look at his history, nothing in it anywhere suggests that he would ever receive an NFL paycheck , it’s astonishing that he’s been able to be in the league for five years
    I’ve been defending you this whole time coach. Not sure I can do it anymore. You are way too stubborn with the QB position and unfortunately you’re going to lose the locker room. Can see it coming from a mile away. and I know damn well you’ll be starting Zach again next week and even more disappointing you won’t pull him if he plays like trash. What kind of a head coach keeps his QB in when he has 30 yards passing in the first half. This has happened too many times. Even though I like Zach and I’m always pulling for him I’m just so tired of it being so damn hard for us to get 1 damn 1st down. It makes me not even want to watch and support the team and I’m a life long fan.
    “We gotta be better” is what coaches say when they don’t know what to do. Next is “we have to figure it out”. Finally “we have to execute”.
    Saleh said he had to calm down the team prior to the season as they were too "cocky" LOL!!! They are very lucky they aren't 0-3 and if he thinks Zack Wilson is going to take them to the postseason he is greatly mistaken
    Well look at the bright side. The McDonald culture at TN is still there... amazing McDonald-Carter-esq performance by them. They might actually tie our OL for last place this year under Carter. Even Hackett last year was 2-1 so we have something to compare. There is NO chance... and I do mean ZERO that we beat the Dolphins if we couldn't stand up to NE. Healthy QB or not... Miami did some major work, as a fan I want to hedge my bet on Tua's health but no chance. I believe my 2d grade teacher, MS. Loughlin is a better QB1. I wonder... when will Saleh understand that its his job or Zack's "progress"? I wonder where the OL Whisperer JD is? Seems a couple of years ago he was "I am the OL whisperer..." Isn't that the touting point that we were given? I get it. Everyone got super amped about a 3rd Q rally (ish). "Zack found his tempo"... yep... he suuuure did. So do you want to get fired over Zach? Seriously... of all of the Jets fans... how many of you would gladly loose your career over Zach Wilson? Does JD? Does anyone? Why not just come out and say that you are tanking. Might as well. The other big tank is AZ. At least their D is showing up for some games to a goofy coach.
    Correction, we HAD a great locker room. You can see on their faces how unhappy the team is. Furthermore, it's not fair to the up and coming stars on this team.
    His answers are like a broken record. The problem is in front of his mirror
    This is HC Saleh's 3rd year I think. He is truly out of his depth when it comes to supporting the offense.. He is a wonderful orator and leader I am sure but his requisite skills as a leader of the organisation are not adequate to get the jets over the hump.
    Bring Rex back!!
    Unfortunately for us jet fans is going no where because of the relationship his father has with woody Johnson
    Rodgers got hurt the season ended at that moment thats it , the mistake was bringing Zach back in the first place ,but once Rodgers got hurt everyone in that room was powerless to be prevent the inevitable outcome which was a long painful death
    They're not going to get rid of the coaching staff with Rodgers saying that he's coming back
    If Saleh is still all in on Zack, then it is time for both to go. Bad News, Guys, The Jets get to see the Chiefs next Sunday night. The best QB against the worst QB, who could ask for anything more? The only thing that Zack does well is run like a frightened Jack Rabbit when the Defense closes in on him. Maybe, if he spent a little more time making Reads with his receivers, we might get more than 7 points a game from him and that is on his good day. Frankly,this is the accepted Business Model of the Jets Owner. Pay a little as possible to the Players, except for Rodgers for four snaps, pay off some journalists to spread the Lie that playoffs are right around the corner, and make the worst QB College picks you can ever make. Has worked out well for the past fifty years. Face it, Jets fans, you are being played like a fiddle while the Jets lives like a Dividend baby with Johnson and Johnson and with the NFL TV contracted Millions he gets each year.
    In fairness, it wasn't his worst game no interceptions however he did missed open receivers his field vision is horrible he missed Wilson who was open many times
    The plan was for ZW is sit for year and hope he could learn something because he wasn’t ready - to not bring in someone is not fair to team or fans.
    I think there seems to be a perception complex that Zach IS the Jets, and to be fair to him, that's a lot of weight to carry. I don't think these losses are all on him, but because there has been so much focus on his past 2 years because he was 1st round, 2nd pick of the NFL draft, expectations continue to be so high that any other player could make the worst plays all season, and it would still go unnoticed and Zach would be the blame, as per usual. Let's be honest, Jets offense suck!! Zach has next to no protection, but because he was the 2nd pick, the golden child should be able to withstand all 90% collapsed Jets defenses during offence, which it seems, anybody who hates Zach, pretends to not see, yet, still expect Zach to somehow magically pull off plays! Time for Jets offense to take more accountability for losses.
    CUT Day On Monday staring with Offensive line!!! Cut,Cut, Cut Cut, 🏈
    people who blame the last two games on Zach are not watching the games, the jets are facing offensive line troubles like I've never seen before and the play calling is not doing him any favors. you could make the argument that he should be able to audible out into better plays but I don't know how much leash their giving him, when they let him pass on first down he was able to make good throws and pass down the field. I believe the jets are close to getting all there cogs turning in the right direction, I'm hopeful Hackett figures out a solid game plan for the kid, back to back games where the QB is getting pressured in 1 to 2 seconds on passing downs is not cutting it.
    Saleh's toast. He's gone. Consistently out coached year after year. Belichik puts his stud rookie CB against best receivers, travelled with Garrett Wilson today who was invisible.
    Supported Saleh and this franchise through thick and thin, but this has become unbearable. Every season it’s the same mediocre quarterback play being very very lightly criticized , to save the 1% of confidence these horrible choices they picked as first round QBs , May have and not being brutally honest or doing what’s needed to win or keep a fan base. After this offseason , I was sold we turned it around and could shock the league and ohhh we shocking the league .... BY GIVING THE SAME GUY WE JUST HAD TO GO GET A 40 YR Old Rodgers for START AND BLOW ANOTHER SEASON!!! It’s pathetic and I’m out for the Saleh And Zw experiment. Zach Lost me and Now Saleh just did too 🤕Really ashamed
    i think they are looking for a QB, Saleh for the first time looked very uncomfortable lying to the media. He knows how bad Zach was. But he's right, for now Zach is there best option, till they bring in someone else. The question is who?? Zach also was playing scared. Afraid to make a mistake. That one drive you can tell he didnt think about it , he just did what he was supposed to do. The last two drives he was thinking too much. The stage is too big for him right now
    If I was him I would trade for a better tight end and an offensive line. This will help the offense and gives him a little more help. But he seems pissed he doesn’t know what to do.
    If you have 2 quarterbacks and Zach is the best option then you have no quarterbacks
    We may need a new coach..
    Watching that game was painful. Soo painful. Dolphins must have played a complete different ball game.
    Keep moving Brother.. we be alright
    Really hoped Saleh worked for us long term but I know the look of a deteriorating coach when I see one...
    Love ya Rob.. don’t fall on the Zach sword. At some point YOU will have to lead us. Zach had one great drive in his 3 year career… time to make a decision
    It would also help if he could pass the ball. Running in the pouring rain didn't work.
    Crazy how a New York NFL team can’t afford picking up a real QB after losing rodgers. Wilson is not the answer this needs to end went to the game today and it was torture to watch
    It is Sad but Saleh is Clueless. ​Oline was not perfect (Becton gives up the Safety and Tippmann got bulled over), Playcalling was Bad but above all, Zach was Bad. He gives us the Best Chance to Win? Any reps for Boyle - "No." Tell me that Woody is forcing him to play. This is sad for Jets fans. Bring in a Vet a at least save your team from imploding.
    We need to play the whole game in the hurry up offense Zach plays better , he has less time to think about things, our defense not pass rushing good either, why don't Salah switch thing up sometimes and play a 3-4 defenses sometimes to stop the run our defense is so predictable just like the offense
    Joe D needs to talk to Aaron about taking over as HC, and bring in an aggressive DC like Rex. I'm tired of both our offense and defense being completely predictable. Football is decided when your 11 guys on offense know the play and the defense does not, that is never the case with our offense, and the opposing offense always knows what our defense will do. And cheapskate Woody Johnson, build a dome out of your own pocket, with better footing the whole game could have been different.
    I almost long for Mark Sanchez after seeing Zack Wilson. Almost
    Saleh is showing he's NOT the guy to lead this org by saying 'Zach gives us the best chance to win'. Just unbelievable. It's laughable, but then again, it's the Jets.
    He was asked if it was fair to stick with zach wilson and he says "yeah" How is that any different then asking zach if he let down the defense last year and he said "NO"
    Coach the last two have been on you. It's your job to make everybody better and execute. Not just dream about being better when you go to bed. Back in 1986, bill Parcells told bill belichik if your dime defense doesn't work, you're fired during the middle of action. It's your job to light a firecracker under hackett. Something no one has said no pundit. But they all are starting to blame you now. Jeff has been fine. Its on you coach and hackett. Get it together quick. ❤️
    The jets isn't going nowhere if Zack Wilson still playing
    I think its obvious the Jets have decided to Tank without saying it explicitly. You cant see the Qb play the 3 weeks think its acceptable to continue without signing a competent QB This either the most irresponsible front office or they are tanking on purpose.
    Yes we have a great locker room besides o line and Coaching. Trade dalvin cook or stop putting him in as much. breece hall is OUR guy that we drafted. Thought hackysack would be better
    Being an aaron rogers fan i was really looking forward to the jets season , then Achilles injury ...and wilson ...their season is probably over , its not realistic to think they can make the playoffs after watching wilson agaisnt the pats , they should have beaten them!
    12-25, no playoff appearances. 0-5 against the Patriots. Am I missing anything?
    He keeps blaming the run game. .it's not just the opponents' defense or the lack of running game. Wilson is not the answer. Ask Robert the question: "Are you sticking with Wilson in hopes of increasing his trade value? Is that fair to your team?"
    You go from having Rodgers being de facto OC to now having to depend on Nathaniel Can't Hackett and Zach Wilson. It's the worst offensive combo in the league. Sorry Jets fans, this season ended the moment Rodgers went down and the Jets didn't immediately make a move at QB and OC.
    They were held ransom by Rodgers and now that he isn’t playing the whole staff got exposed. Hackett thought he was just going to collect a check and kick back now that he has to work he is also wetting the bed. The defense can’t catch there breath. Saleh needs to bench Zach, if Boyle isn’t the QB either Saleh and staff need to go. JD gets a pass but he needs to draft better at QB.
    Need to get a QB for this season Zach is not it, there was several open rcerviers he just did not see he is in slow motion.
    3:18 im shocked and in disbelief Tim Boyle wont get reps w the starters in case baby face crappy Zach goes down or keeps playing like shit. I can't Believe Salah had the nerve to say, its fair to the other teammates that they keep sticking with 3:24 Zach He should get a fire just by saying yes. We all. are watching the same game. Feels like the jets want to tank the season on purpose keeping ZW at the helm. If i was on that team especially offense, i would go on strike until they use a different qb. That is a total Fu*k to the other teammates in the locker room keeping a child on the field that is CLEARLY NOT READY!! I got no words left im going to have a stroke if i keep going.
    Opportunities is all I hear from him and they went and signed a RB and go after more defensive pieces when you had a older QB and a young dummy QB that sees ghosts… The coach failed this team
    We not gonna take about how bad the playcall are, and then adding bad oline, equal a recipe for disaster
    Great now there will be 60,000 chiefs fans in MetLife Sunday night knowing Zach is starting again
    " You Play The KC Cheifs On SNF Next Week..How Bad Do You Think You"ll Lose ?" 😁🏈🏈
    I bet the jets coaching staff is going to be pouring over the Dolphins' game tape from this weekend, trying to pull a few nuggets that they think they can quickly implement to get Zach rolling.
    Zack is holding the ball to long. Jets needs to help him a lot, running the ball a lot more.
    now their weaknesses are glaring and can be addressed for NEXT year
    As a lifelong Jeff fan, it’s time for the Johnson family to fire everyone and then sell the team ‼️👍‼️
    The Jets should tank this season and hope to draft Caleb Williams and have him sit one season behind Rogers and let Wilson go via trade or release… Wilson is a bust this is the best of him they should have kept Mike White this past offseason and released Wilson
    1st drive of the game Zach audible a running play to the strong side of the defense 5 yard loss 😅😅 The kid is having a hard time seeing the game
    Both offensive and defensive coaching is the problem. Plays called in the first half was soooo predictable and waste of time.
    It's hard to be positive about ZW. .. He looks lost most of the time.
    Saleh still taking receipts
    I am sure Saleh has been begging Joe to bring in another QB. Who knows what; they have been trying to do in the background. Hopefully, they have been negotiating with the Vikings, and we can bring in Cousins for a 3rd rounder by Tuesday....Zach Wilson can't play the position.
    Fire him
    You cannot start Zach Wilson again. That is a fire-able offense if you do.
    They should have hired Mike McCarthy when they had the chance.
    Zach just needs a few more years to develop, then he’s going to be 👌
    They put all their eggs in one Rogers basket 😂😂
    THE JETS SHOULD HAVE SIGNED GENO SMITH IN THE OFFSEASOM.
    Yet ANOTHER whole season down the tubes thanks to an inept coaching staff who refuses to admit that Wilson is the worst qb in the league. 50% completions today. Until they jetison this loser, we aren't winning any games this year. I'm way over listening to Saleh tell us how much trust he has in Wilson. If he truly believes that Wilson is the best option right now, he doesn't deserve to be a head coach. The honeymoon with this guy (Saleh) is over.
    Shhhhh you are who you are, The New York Jets.
    Every year we anticipate on how good we think we are the next season 😂
    Rodgers won’t be come back without Saleh and Hackett, so everyone calling for their heads after a 1-2 start needs to sober up and come back tomorrow
    Can't have a great locker room when you're arguing on sidelines`,

    contents: `Man I shed tears for Zach tonight when he was making those throws. Beautifully. I was so proud of him. This wasn’t just a game. There was more pressure on him than most people could take and wow !! He was inspiring. So proud and happy for him. I’m sad he feels down and I get it. But I hope tomorrow or the next day. He can feel proud of what he did tonight.
    Congrats to the Chiefs and the refs for a hard fought victory.
    Saleh has that Dan Campell dedication to his team. He loves those players. Keep building
    If Zach can start showing us that week after week, this season might be salvageable. 1-3 is a tough start to the season, but after tonight it looked like a lot of the pieces have started to be put together.
    Not even a jets fan and I jumped out of my seat on that two point conversion. Rooting for Zach to prove everyone wrong
    Hell of a game! We keep playing this way and playoffs is definitely back in play. Conducting Jets Therapy Wednesday, I know we still need it ✈
    "I have a lot of thoughts on it, but I'm going to stay quiet" That's the worst part, you can't even criticize the NFL officiating, they know they're untouchable.
    I am proud to be a JETS fan!
    Refs owe us an apology. Absolutely disgusting ending to a great performance by Zach and the crew. We were robbed. #nojustice
    We all knew the NFL wouldn't let the Jets win that game
    I know " it was close" doesn't mean anything to NFL but Jets played really well. Keep going coach!!
    You have to give Saleh credit. Packers fan here, knowing how good he did as a defensive coordinator with the times Green Bay played against the Niners in his days, he knew how to lead a team and has a ton of energy. Saleh knows exactly what he’s doing. Yes it’s hard to like believe in his recent decisions with Zach Wilson, but he’s a coach that’s got full on pride, leadership, etc. Full on respect with what he’s done with the Jets and continuing especially with what he’s put together for that organization
    Zach played his heart out, that fumble is no different from any 1 of Mahomes picks
    Not a Jets fan, but it was so clear the refs were against the jets tonight. Really proud you got that unsportsmanlike conduct call, way to stick up for your players. They played great, you called a great game, F the refs.
    What a tough loss! The Jets played great on both sides of the ball tonight!
    The Jets played their hearts out!! All respect! I can only fathom so much about the disappointment in that call the refs made against the Jets. Stay strong out there Jets!!
    Saleh had every right to be upset! The Refs made so many bad calls in the end! The NFL should be ashamed!
    Chiefs fan here. Nothing but respect for the Jets. Saleh is a class act.
    Tough loss tonight but I'm sure coach Saleh will rally the troops and have the guys ready to play and win next game. Just got a few loose ends to tie up. Go Jets!
    I'm a Chiefs fan and I'm here to compliment Zach Wilson! Dude looked great👏
    The INT holding call aside, there is no way they just missed the hold on #11 on the other 3rd and long. My god, it was for 10 seconds and the lineman lifting him off the ground. Guess I cant watch chiefs games anymore, since they aren't even trying to hide the rigging when Mahomes is involved.
    I’m a lions fan but I really like this jets team. They’re SO CLOSE to making it all click.
    I think this is was a career turning game for Zack. His back was against the wall and he came out. I was legit rooting for him during the game!!
    Saleh is a good coach! Love how he is professional when he needs to be and loves his team. I am not a Jets fan but after watching Hardknocks , I got know the team and I appreciate all they hard work. I thought they did darn good playing the Chiefs- hopefully next time they will beat them.
    So proud of Zach after tonight's performance. All media in NY and Nationally and many of our fans have been shitting on his name since Rodgers went down. That's pressure! Fuck all the haters! Let's fucking go! J...E...T...S...Jets, Jets, Jets!
    From a Chiefs fan this was a battle to the end. Respect to coach Salah and the team. The Jets are going to throw a wrench in some teams plans.
    so much respect for this man. loved him in SF, love him now.
    Okay so I'm on the Zack train. He didn't give up and really put his all in the 2nd quarter and I admire that. We all should. Yes it was a loss but I really think we can build on that and I think Zack fell into a rhythm, releasing the ball faster which he has to do. So I hate that we lost but I do feel optimistic.....And our defense is just out of this world. Wow!
    The play design/schematics this week were 1,000,000% better than last week, thanks Hacket!!! Way better...still room to improve...maybe one more short fast route on the other side too.
    Zach played great tonight. Keep it up coach you're doing great.
    Refs did their job Protect Chiefs from upset. Jets showed heart. Everything is rigged folks.
    1-3 is a rough start but honestly if the Jets could’ve had that game And it was a hell of A game , they fought with some absolute BS calls but Zach Wilson played his ass off and I couldn’t be more proud of the kid
    Very nice surprice for the QB play and with Arons' support wins should be coming. The OC defanlty made changes to fit Wilsons abilities his confidence is growing plus his team mates can see this bug change in hi performance
    I am a hardcore Chiefs fan (since 95, long before Mahomes) and that holding call was absolutely bs. The call itself wasnt bs (because it could have went either way) the fact that it was right when the INT happen. You got robbed🎉
    Hes hurt bro shit sucks love him for the dedication it’s why I love this coach
    REFS blew that on that long run mahomes jets were getting held no call then call on the d next play unreal.
    As a Chiefs fan I think everyone is rooting for Zach. The young man has been unfairly criticized and he BALLED out last night. Zach now believes! Look out NFL!
    I will say after watching most games on Sunday that this defense was violent. The hardest hitting bunch I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS! great job guys wow anyone plays these guys be carful. Im not a diehard by the way lol
    Hell of a game, much respect
    Chiefs were the heavy favorites coming into the game and the Jets gave them trouble all night! Hell of a game from Zach as well dude has a bright future for sure
    Jets have a top 5 defense they gave us fits all night. Good team great defense
    They got hosed on that game by the refs ! The Jets I believe would have won that game. Congratulations all around to the Jets ! The Defense, The Offense, Special teams, You deserved better than that, you did not lose that game. The Refs did !!!
    Aaron needs to be there every game bruh
    Atta Boy, Saleh! I think he's having his Dan Campbell moment one season later. I'm loving it! Keep the fire, Robert!
    He (zach)played with much more confidence today. Jets will be in a lot of close games if they play the same way today every game going forward
    That fourth quarter was just hard to watch. This jets team is such a fun team to follow. I hope they get over the jump - I’m cheering for em
    Refs ruined the game but at least next week I’ll be excited. Let’s see if Zach can keep it up.
    Chiefs fan here. I thought it was a hold. Yea they went both ways uncalled all night. That’s how it goes. Notwithstanding, the Jets are a SCARY good team. I don’t think we have seen a defense that good in the modern era and if Wilson can play like he did on that insane drive on a consistent basis, chiefs and jets Be facing off in the playoffs every year
    Not a Jets or KC fan but that is heartbreaking call from the refs. Jets were down big and they fought like hell to get back just to get an absolutely deflating penalty called against them. Is there a rule that Mahomes isn't allowed to throw 3 picks in a game?
    This is a win in my books! Ref took this one from us
    Let’s go Zach! Keep stacking
    Hell of a fight from the Jets man. Y’all got hosed multiple times on the final drive. Nothin but love from Duval.
    love the jets, they always fight to win, thats why i am a big fan
    We got robbed. Zach played great tonight LETS GO JETS!!!
    What a heartbreak. One more catch here, one less bad call and the Jets win. Except for the fumble Zach played very well. Tough loss.
    the only upside to what happened to you guys is this. You proved the Chiefs are posers, they will not make it to the Super Bowl with the level of play they had tonight unless the NFL fully pulls the mask aside and rigs things to an impossible degree. You made them struggle, you proved the sports media wrong, you have restored confidence in Zach Wilson. We are rooting for you even if the system is against you. I'm a Cardinals fan but Jets have a place in my heart after tonight.
    Man I felt his pain last night! That was bs.
    I'm a Packer fan and the ref's D-holding call against Sauce was horrible the key play of the game - there was no holding - makes the game look rigged. THE ONLY REAL CHANCE FOR THE CHIEFS TO MAKE A 1ST DOWN (3RD AND 22) WAS FOR THE REFS TO CALL A PENALTY. Wife and I are sick of the NFL allowing that call to stand...anyone who knows football knows that call was bogus.
    I was going to hate on Saleh because I'm a bum but his rant which got him flagged changed my mind he had a lot of passion he showed he cared for the team he's like a Dan Campbell and that's something to really build on, loved to see it.
    From KC, Best of luck the rest of the season. Great game
    I'll comment on the holding call that decided the game. Defensive holding should be ten yards and no automatic first downs. The current rule allows dishonesty by referees. How many $ are involved in a aingle KC or San Francisco win and why do these two teams get so many game deciding defensive holding calls.
    3rd & 22 No Call was Egregious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    I feel good cuz everyone knows that was our dub n we got robbed n regardless Zach played beautiful tonight n looked promising i hope aaron comes to more games n we keep this going the D ia always 🔥 and on point
    It kills me that a referee can make a call to change the outcome of a game without penalty. But the losing team’s coach, who hit screwed, gets penalized if he simply complains about the bad call after the game. What a messed up system.
    Lions fan here. Love the way you guys FIGHT. Was hoping y’all would pull this one out. 100% agree with Saleh letting the ref have it. When that hasn’t been called all game and wait til AFTER an interception on 3rd and TWENTY is egregious. Made me and everyone outside of KC sick. Anyway.. good luck the rest of the season. Hopefully you all don’t run into many more NFL golden boys that get all the calls.
    The league is showing its true colors. Their cheated for the chiefs in the Super Bowl, and tonight in prime time. It’s pretty gross who consistently inconsistent in ref calling holding and interference. If you gonna get a call for hitting a QB. You should actually hit the QB! Best to the Jets!
    Zac had good games his first year, his second year, and now this year. We all want the kid to do good, but till proving otherwise they should make a trade for a veteran backup like Colt McCoy just in case.
    Jets played great football, never lost hope, it was a tough loss...
    The defense did what they needed to do for one quarter lol but even then they dropped 2 ints, held Valdez-Scantling, and could not catch Patrick in time. That being said it was a very good game to watch I just hate that it’s coming down to the calls again when he was clearly stopping him from running his route just like the call in the Super Bowl. Obviously coach gonna be mad that he had a chance and they lost it over the fumble.
    That looked like an entirely different office from the first few weeks. If the Jets keep building on that they'll be scary by the end of the year.
    Keep this same energy going on to next week !!!
    Jets got robbed. The refs were in the tank for KC. We all saw it.
    Lots of play and calls cost Jets the game, including that one snap. But not just the snap.
    I implore the Jets to send the refs a fine. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE refs tonight. It is clear they are in Vegas' pocket.
    I'm not a Jets fan but that was a bad call. He decides to throw the flag after the fact. That pissed me off. Not sure about the QB yet but y'all got a hell of a coach and a great defense. Is Cooks hurt or something? He ain't running right.
    We got robbed. Zach is a baller!!
    The Holy Roller, The Tuck Rule, and now, The Gambler Game….30 for 30 staring us right in the face with these greedy, gambler refs fellas
    I looked up this interview just to see if he would comment on the INT holding flag. It's very suspicious that it wasn't thrown until after the ball was picked. I know bad calls go both ways, but damn lol. That one was game deciding
    Looks like he may still have a career as an NFL QB.
    Ngl beating the Chiefs is tough as hell man, refs do show them a ton of favoritism. Heck even at MetLife.
    Mad respect for coach saleh and Ulbrich. Making Mahomes look like Woody 🤠 😂 just flimsy, unbalanced and pale.
    I knew Zach would play good this game I was telling guys at the bar that the Jets would win this game I was off by four points but it was a good scare.
    Lets just face the facts. The Chiefs are the NFL/media darlings now and ALL the close calls go there way.
    Let’s talk about the horse collar tackle on the Chiefs that wasn’t. let’s just cry about the holding call your player got caught on at the end, check his reaction to the call banging his helmet knowing full well what he did just got caught😢😢😢😢😢😢
    Bears fan here and this was a good game
    Not a Jets fan or a Zach Wilson fan, but that holding call that was missed on the most penalized OL in the league on 3rd and forever was criminal. It was obvious in real time. No replay required. Just made worse by the bullsh*t call on Sauce to take a pick away. The NFL has an integrity problem.
    Great game coach..... it's going to all fall into place.....
    The coach is upset about a couple of calls that didn't go his way but the Chiefs got a couple of calls that didn't go their way too! The Chiefs overcame and the Jets didn't!
    Im a niner fan but I feel so bad for the Jets. KC always getting calls that save their little asses. These refs need to be investigated
    Hard Knocks had/has me pulling for Zach Wilson I'm not a jets fan but it showed us a different/human side to him that non-jet fans typically won't get to see. I only knew the media's negativity train that was riding his ass rougher than penitentiary love scene 🫣🫣🥹🥹🙈🙈 Just Imagine how good he'd be after backing up Arod for potently a few yrs Rogers appeared to have taken him under his wing. hell it all could've been creative editing 🤔 lol like most nfl fans i could not for week 1 and the jets played a big part in it.... not to mention the officials always gives KC a BS call just when they need it. They got every call to go their in every damn playoff gm last yr; hell he's this generations nxt Tom Brady
    Amazing composure after the egregious officiating undermining everything that they work hard for. NFL should be embarassed at what they just committed on prime time. Huge loss for the world outside of KC. Which week are we boycotting?
    Referees gave that game to him they control too much of the NFL
    Good game guys. We were robbed by the refs!!
    Bad Ass Fighters!!!!
    Chiefs fan here. Zach gutted it out. Tough defense. Good core players on this team.
    If only this had baseball rules because he would’ve been out there screaming at the refs 10 minutes after he was ejected
    The Jets look good coming back damn stop losing
    Coach called his timeouts well
    Great job Coach
    I know Mahomes is Mahomes, but damn he won the game for Chiefs killing the time off and avoiding mayhem. Oh yeah, but shouldn't have because of that BS PI call!`,

    contents: `Sean Payton packs some impressive credentials. Nathaniel Hackett has an impressive resume, also. I'll be honest. As a 45 year Broncos fan, I haven't been very happy the last couple of seasons. I will say this, though. Coach Hackett has always presented himself as a humble, respectful, hard working guy. Coach Payton, on the other hand, has always come off as aloof and arrogant. His bad mouthing of Hackett was one of the most unprofessional things I'd ever heard from an NFL coach. Since Denver will be lucky to finish the season with 3 wins, I can honestly say that I'm happy that Nate got a little revenge. Good luck to the Jets the rest of the season.
    One "HALL" of a game 💪🏽🏈
    Congrats Zach, Breece, Sauce, and all of you🎉 You’re worthy and we’re with you. Keep battling and finding ways to win each game🎉
    I hope AVT is OK. Zach did Zach stuff. Breece was🔥🔥. The defense was really awesome when it counted. ✈️✈️✈️
    Jets can make history next Sunday by beating Philly. Let's go......
    Zach played very well with the exception of that INT, gotta protect that rock but other than that, an all around back to back game from the kid he gotta work on that for sure no doubt
    I think the decision on Zach's INT was a good decision, he just needed to throw a better ball. Also, great play by Sustain II
    Way to win a game that we all know meant something to us! ✈️
    Good news on Tipp. Fingers crossed on AVT. Props to Max Mitchell for holding it down well in the meantime.
    What a draft class 2022 was!!! Best since I’ve been a fan dating back to 97
    So happy for you! Go Jets!!
    Congrats Jets fans. Hard fought game pretty clean played game given all the talk about Paytons comments but yall deserved the win. Good luck the rest of the season.
    That was a good game continue winning go Jets
    Glad we won but so many self inflicted mistakes. Blood pressure goes through the roof every game. Can we get one blow out? This was the game if we opened it up more and get Cook out of the line up. Those carries werent bad today but I'm guessing BH would have had another TD with a few more carries.
    Awesome win!! But coaches need call a better plan in the end zone! Run, run, pass ain’t it
    A win is a win, but we got to get the ball in the end zone, mix it up, flanker screen, eye formation etc
    Why am I seeing fans in the comments that are mad? We won!
    I’m really hoping the AVT injury isn’t too bad
    Left about 20 points on the field let’s get them next week
    I love the Hall runs, but could we give Zach some more trust and let Wilson and Lazard work? Running 1st and 2nd most of the 4th had me stressing.
    Big gains on the ground by opposing offense. Tackle, tackle....
    Not bad. Getting better every week
    Zach played great. Interception was just a great play by surtain
    It was ugly but a W is a W take that any day
    Happy for the W, but that throw to open field with time running out in the first half-- Zach's mom probably would know better than that. NY Giant fans used to call that the "prevent offense."
    Zach played ok, Defense played great but need stop these QBs from running on us.. Beat Philly and I'll believe again..
    As a Giants fan I'm happy jets won.. Broncos hahaha
    Great adjustments today coach
    TIME TO ROCK AND ROLL. Will miss AVT against eagkes
    Zach played well with the exception of the int gotta protect the ball Zach other than that good job
    Ulbrich did well so did Hack
    31 points!
    You beat a Bronco team that gave up 70pts. Don’t be too happy.
    Subtle shots fired
    Sounds like AVT will be out for the season, just the way he said he has to be evaluated further, that's never good when it comes to the Jets.
    Sean Payton taking that medicine. Your boy Brees isn't around to carry your load. "Hall of Fame" coach... HAH! 2023, Coach Belichick and Payton are eating some unbelievably delicious humble pie! Those guys sure looked like genius coaches when they had generational, long-term generals leading their offenses. Take away two of the best to ever play the position and suddenly both of these guys look like any other head coach.
    Sahleh took the high road
    the beard is the game changer.
    Avp 🙏🏻 ! Let’s hope !
    For as long as I can remember - with a few exceptions - I've watched team, after team, after friggin' team make adjustments that the Broncos just can't keep up with. This is as ugly as it was in the late 60s - early 70s. Atrocious.
    Jeremiah 29:11 - For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. God bless! Jesus is the way and saves! Psalms 62✝🤍💪
    Great win we needed💚🤍
    Nice win.
    Get those timeouts straight
    COACH!!
    The super jets......Go jets Go👍👋👋👋👌
    J-E-T-S
    Give Quincy Williams your check this week.. he saved your ass
    Gipson was awful. The Jets are 0-12 lifetime against the Eagles. Saleh looked incompetent at the half.
    AVT going down is gonna suck!
    AVT is never allowed in Denver again
    Rodgers has released the Brett Favre
    They ALWAYS get us on a coupla screens...why do we come out on defense so slow? Zach still sucks...
    I'm 66 Hall reminds me of Oj and Sanders
    First quater play calls terrible!
    Shoutout coach
    Who is the Brick that Saleh keeps mentioning? Can't be Ferguson.
    Back to reality next week😂
    bearded saleh is a menace
    Penalties!
    NYC Hack Reporters are a joke always looking for that sound bite.
    Jets will run the table. Gritty not pretty
    Hackett's RZ planning SUCKS!!
    BREECE LIGHTNING HALL
    Right now you totally suck in the red zone!
    Not very impressive salah, zack was horrible again!
    1:09 LMAOO
    Time to clear house
    I support Mims Jr
    Be humble... sit down
    ZW still sucks
    Horrible coaching horrible quarterback. Didn’t deserve this W
    Zach is a nothing. If he played on a different team all the clueless newbies, who believe in him, would be calling him trash. Justin Fields would have made us a scary team. Draft a real quarterback next year. And fire the overrated Sleepy Joe Douglas next year. Him and his one good draft.
    Yeahhhh!!! real special game huh😂 we'll see what happens next time yall face a good team😂😂😂`,

    contents: `Defense played amazing and Zach made no mistakes. Excellent work
    Saleh Is right there on the sidelines. No charts in his hand. His eyes are glued to the field at all times. Completely absorbed in the game and coordinating everything with his OC and DC. He reminds me of the old NFL coaches. Good for him.
    Love how he is sharing the credit. Naming the different position coaches as well as the players. Great leader
    We have to give coach Robert Saleh a lot of credit for keeping his team together during what looks like disaster! Amazing job!
    A lot of folks don't realize how close this team is to sitting at 5-1 right now. One terrible call against the Chiefs and a late game drive against the Pats and this season is looking a lot different. Keep grinding and impressing
    49er fan here and just major kudos for the Jets win over the Eagles. I was a little down when we lost to the Browns today but, this made it all better.
    Defense continuing to keep us in the game time after time. And as Zach builds more and more confidence while finding his groove; the Jets can only get better! 🎉 #GANGREEN
    Defense put all their heart in . Good job guys we are proud of you. ❤️🏈🇺🇸
    Philly was there to be beat. Best win of Saleh's career! If Rodgers was QBing we'd have at least 3 more TDs.
    The defense that we've built is next level when we want to be 🤯✈️
    Great win for this team!Your defense was amazing and I couldn’t be happier that the Jets got the DUB!Outstanding 👏🏻👏🏻
    Love my team. All the setbacks and still out there swinging and knocking em down as needed. Amazing man
    3-3 is right where we suppose to be with what we had to deal with...keep playin great jets !!
    If you don't like Robert Salah, there's something wrong with you
    Bills fan here. Rooted for the Jets ❤ After they were robbed last week, they SOO deserved this win. Bigger DUB than beating the Qweefs would have ever been. Bravo!!
    Zach is just so poised.. he has learned not to get greedy or rattled and take what the defense gives him.
    If Zach keeps this up. He’s got some potential. Still alot of growing but hes headed in the right direction
    I don’t care what anyone says. I’m riding with #2 ✈️. Our defense is unstoppable even when a QB game manages a game.
    49er fan here congratulations guys this was a superb win. You have an amazing coach.
    For this team to be out so many players and still play this well speaks to the locker room and mentality they’ve bred into this whole organization
    Bills fan here. That was impressive defensive play. Insanity. 3 corners out and stopped the eagles high powered offense. Well done. Hats off. Also Robert saleh is an awesome coach.
    Best game I’ve ever been to, team showed a lot of heart and never gave up. Proud to be a Jets fan.
    One day we’ll witness Rodgers with this defense
    We all knew the D was good that’s why Rodgers came but Wilson is really improving. Love to see Rodgers on the sidelines.
    I dont care if zach never throws for 200 let alone 300 if he can protect the ball like he has the last 2 wks. Man what a win going into bye week wow. Even with aaron I was hoping for 4-2 at the bye...we can do this boys!!!!
    We love you Robert 💪🏼
    Great game coach....great game plan....the defense was superb
    Im so happy Aaron is looking great in his recovery. And its a real weapon just to have him there in Zach's ear. Really a great mentor and it shows in the kid's play.
    If this team gets better both sides of the field we are a contender ✊🏽
    First thing is first. Pay who ever is managing everything on Defense! The scouter, the caller, the teacher. We need to sign that dude LONG TERM!! This was phenomenal!
    Great game! Im so hyped right now all i can say is go Jets!
    This was a complete team win! Now let’s get healthy through the bye week and get ready for the 2nd half of our season! Go Jets!
    Great win! So happy that horrible streak is gone.
    Number 1 defense in the league baby!!!!! #jets
    defense played immensely great, and Zach Wilson made no mistakes, hopefully the offense gets quick enough, at least a good well deserved bye week until October 29th
    Gutsy win by the NY Jets. Their defense proved tonight they should be number 1 in the rankings.
    Huge win 3-3 never looked so good!
    TOE TO TOE WITH ANYBODY. THATS RIGHT. LETS GO JETS!
    Give Robert huge credit for sticking with Zach after the Patriots game and now Wilson is getting better week by Week and the season is salvageable at 3-3 with the bye week coming up.
    The pressure of the Jets defense was excellent and also contained Jalen Hurts well. Jets stayed in the game and made a bunch of big plays to win it.
    The Jets season is a roller coaster! Absolutely wild
    The Jets scoring defense is under 20 PPG, and that was against 4 of the best teams in the NFL Now, their schedule lightens up considerably. They have two games against the Dolphins, one more with the Bills, and the rest are very winnable games. Among the easiest remaining schedules in the NFL
    Amazing. GREAT DEFENSE
    Between Sauce, Garrett, Jermaine and Breece just an amazing draft
    I stand by you coach
    That one hurt, but hats off to the Jets ! 🦅
    Great DC, great leader, good head coach. I think Saleh is gonna be a fixture in NY for awhile.
    GREAT JOB COACH!!!!! Playing championship defense with a secondary full of backups.
    I love this team!! Let’s go!!!
    All the haters like Nick Wright Stephen A Shannon Sharpe Rob Parker and Chris Broussard gotta eat crow and admit they were wrong about Zach Wilson and the Jets
    Them boys balled out✈️✈️✈️
    J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS!🎉🎉🎉
    As a cowboys fan thank you jets 🙏 🎉
    Let’s go jets! 🛩️ 🔥 💪
    Everyone said even with Rodgers the Jets wouldn't be 3-3 at this time
    So many armchair fans whinging about Z Wilson so far this season - he's done so well with this paperweight O-line ahead of him, (remember all the experts thought Rodgers would struggle behind them, too!).....not to mention the shock of not expecting to play......the defence played out of their skins and when you've got Hall and G.Wilson on the field, you've got a chance. I have faith that the offence will improve.
    Now let’s end the Patriots streak!! LETS GO JETS!!
    So proud of you boys. omfg. what a game. great fucking job coach. love it. LOVE IT. J E T S JETS JETS JETS
    What a win!!!
    You guys are the BEST. Thank you very much from Commanders nation. Fly ✈️ Fly on the road to victory J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS lmao
    What a WIN!!!
    Zach must perfect the 2 second throw from Center to throw short. Purdy has it and easily controls defenses.
    Good for Zack, Wilson, and the Jets. All the media wants to do is blame the quarterback, if we’re being honest, we could’ve very easily been three and three with Aaron Rodgers. Stop acting like we would’ve been undefeated, and stop acting like Aaron Rodgers is Tom Brady. Very happy for Wilson, I hope the team can continue to have success.
    Jets have been through alot and deserve this win! Happy Hurts finally played a good D and got exposed! That good ole 20 minutes in the pocket doesnt happen against good defenses!
    Huge win today coach 💚🤍
    When this team 'get's it!' and begins to click on all cylinders, this will be the team to beat! It's just a matter of the offensive week in week out. I feel the Jets played at 75% to 80% against the eagles. We are almost there, where it WILL HAPPEN!!! The offense does take a little time to click and I have to remind myself of that. The 'D' held that offense to 14 points!!! 14 POINTS!!!! 14 points they had to earn. They can talk injuries, but we have injuries too... The Jets are OH SO CLOSE!!!!!
    Any Given Sunday…Indeed! Way to get the W
    Jets looking solid!
    D-E-F-E-N-S-E
    That was awesome!!
    Any Given Sunday. Go JETS :)
    We are Lights Out on D in the 2nd half.... wow !
    Coach durka is hands down the luckiest coach in the league
    Like I have said. NY Jets are an impossible equation & with multiple formulations..you came up with fantastic game strategy. 11 kisses can Hurt Wowsa! Have a nice break🎉😅
    Great win up next New York Giants😈
    Cant wait to hear the bs from the talking heads about this win. Especially ryan clark who said theres no way the jets win. A lot of them did. Rex said maybe but hes a ex hc hahaha. The excuses or the dues. I wanna hear them say how elite this defense is. They deserve it. Playing corners off the practice squad. So well coached. But theyll only say that bc salah did. W.e. J-E-T-S JETS JETS JETS
    If the Jets ever play against a statue of a QB, they will get 7 sacks in a game. Maholmes, wilson, dak, hurtz, allen, these guys avoided so many sacks
    Eagles didn't score any points the entire second half. Defense Dominance
    Coach Saleh rocks
    Refs tried to screw the Jets after they made that huge pass play to Wilson .
    One game closer to a Zach Wilson tattoo for Saleh
    Not Surprised the Jets beat Philly cuz even though Eagles were undefeated they were not dominant , should have lost to D.C and they had a slew of injuries in key areas. Jets have a top 1 o2 defense that is very deep in every area and brings it every down and now has the league on notice. Jets (Zack)just need to score some damn touch downs from scrimmage they will be the best in the league.That last td was matador by Philly they were defeated by Hurtz INT's (Killed em) because The Jets forced the TO's.
    Is it me or does coach make a good King Xerxes from 300. Great role when done with coaching. 😮
    Huge W
    I know “ifs” are stupid to reflect on…but “if” we convert our Red Zone drives with a TD on a respectable level we’re a one loss team.
    Overall excellent game, but hard to believe they scored the last TD and gave Philly a chance. Isn't Hackett responsible for that,?
    Great job d!!!
    I like the wide spread offense an play hardmore more too
    Tickets!!! Tickets!!! He's got your receipts !!! He's got your receipts!!!
    Do refs ever get fired?? It’s one thing to miss a trivial hold or false start flinch, but to outright hallucinate and see TD’s that didn’t happen….BRUH!!!!
    Jets should be 4-2 with wins over Bills, Chiefs and Philly.
    ❤coach
    When you guys played the Raiders, they have a good guy name, Cosby you guys gonna have to put three players on him take him down he’s too good of a player Quincy Williams, and two other players that are good to take down Cosby so the other half and make a touchdown❤️❤️
    Saleh FTW!!!
    Find another QB if you want to save the season!
    As an eagles fan, congrats to the jets. Do i think it has a lot to do with all the injuries philly dealt with? Yeah. But a win is still a win. Only issue here: Saleh talking about "embarrassing QBs". I get giving credit to your team, but cmon. A very unprofessional comment.
    I believe in Coach Bob
    Just remember how hateful all you Jets fans were being towards Zach a couple weeks ago. Send that man apology’s!!
    Bryce HUFF needs to get an extention ASAP!!!!
    Jets have the worst o line in the nfl by far. Wilson has no chance getting sacked so much. It’s brutally painful & makes any qb rush`,

    The press keeps asking questions about Zach but Saleh won't bite. He talks about the team and what the team needs to work on and how the team needs to keep working together. I love this. Don't let the sport news people create a target for frustration or target to hate on. It's a team sport, they rise and fall together.
    Without Greg the Leg where would we be ? He's our MVP.
    Man that was an ugly W but man the way they got that W was just hard , lots of injuries on both sides but that was just unbelievable, the way they got the W
    I don’t like how these reporters talk about Zach.. the kid’s been balling. The line doesn’t give him much time and he’s working with what he has. He’s vastly improved vs last year
    I'm 65 n have caught alotta crap over the year today's game was what I feel every single yr. I had 2 cardiogenic shock heart attacks one at my job at Costco and one at the Bayonne hospital thank God for both of those places I'm still alive to cheer the Jets n for them to make my heart rumble if I got to go out of this world the Jets better win at least one more super bowl PERIOD YOU GUYS GET ME .🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
    You guys really cleaned up! BRAVO! I believe in the NY Jets!
    I've been a Jets fan my entire life and I'm in my 40s. I don't care. I want sloppy ugly wins over really good losses.
    What a great New York Giants defeat. I love ❤️ every minute of it.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
    Lets go Coach, keep the momentum going!
    Talk about a nail biter. Lol. Thanks for the win. 54 years and still a Jets fan
    Feel really bad for Al "TrenchDaddy" Woods. 😔 That's 3 Achilles heels *so far* on that MetLife turf!   Even Garrett Wilson is on record referring to it as, TRASH... And that's when the weather is good!
    Man, this dude has got to coach waaaaay better! Hope he can!
    These jets are the one of the most ultimate bar fight team of all time
    We aren't playing great team ball but this defense and special teams 🤯 When the offensw is clicking we are lethal (Chiefs) we just have to tap into that more ✈️
    The Jets offense need to buy the defense dinner tonight.
    Lucky win, Jets playing down to the opponent as usual unfortunately. Glad Zack could keep grinding and help get the W
    Let's Go Jets!!!! A win is a win!!!!
    That field is dangerous and players have voiced their concerns. Will Woody have the nuts to force Mara and his field company to change it.
    Just let Zach play and be himself PLEASE!!!!!! Every freaking time you let the kid actually throw down the field and be aggresive he actually looks good and makes clutch plays.. we seen it this year alone like 3 games (in big moments) you guys make him play scared all game and just the whole offense is stale but then when we are down late and they have no choice but to let him be himself and let him throw it, then thats when they finally let him but we are never going to win games like this every time.. gotta stop playing games like that, it’s frustrating and its gonna end in failure.. just let the kid freaking play.. we already seen when you do, it turns out good and he looks good
    This is what football is all about!
    Great win! Now trade for a Center!
    I m not a jets fan but I like Saleh as a coach. And he defended Dabol. Which is cool. Hindsight is 20-20 it's easy to say should've would've cc could've. But once you make a decision you have to stand by it. Good or bad results.
    The Giants have a good defense;. Their offense however is the a huge problem. But Congrats to the Jets!
    We sacrifice an Achilles to the football gods with every win Jets truly must have sold their soul for that first Super Bowl …fuckin wild
    I am a Jet fan so glad they won, but almost let this one slip away. The Jets recently beat a very good team (The Eagles), then struggle to beat a very mediocre team (The Giants) who were using their 3rd string quarterback.
    This was a "moral loss" for Jets.
    8 weeks in and we're still figuring it out
    Football gods hooked us up today. Finally. 🎉
    OL has to be fixed if they want to win
    A lot of resilience. Translates to..... We never stopped fighting when we're behind.... The meaning Is that the Jets never have the lead?. The Jets are always playing from behind. The jets are never good enough but somehow show up when it counts most.
    Ugly W but a W nontheless. Zafh really needs to stop scrambling to the backfield only to get sacked for major losses. Too many times has he caused -10 yd + losses from trying to unnecessarily extend plays. Recieving Core really has to work on completions. Too many very catchable balls were dropped. You can blame the rain all you want but in the end NFL caliber players need to be able to catch balls no matter the terrain or conditions. Amazing work on Defense as always!! OLINE gotta get it figured out with yet another shake up from an injury.
    That win wasn’t pretty but it was very satisfying.
    If Giants blow it up, maybe the Jets can trade for Schmitz to play center. Or maybe we get Tippman back soon and he plays Center
    The last drive...why can't the offense play like that all game?
    mvp today . Greg the leg and Morstead the best punter in league
    We dont need Zach to be great, just to be Trent Dilfer-esque!!😂😅
    This Jets team makes me cry angry and happy at the same time wtf
    Jets and Giants put on one of the most embarrassing shows in NFL history No winners in this one
    J-E-T-S! JETS! JETS! JETS! JETS WIN! Let’s Go JETS!!!!
    That win can best be described as a successful failure.
    Zach 17-36 24 240yards 1 TD on a Breece Screen 2 of 15 on 3rd down conversions. You can’t continue to win this way
    Now we will most likely move some people because of the injuries!
    This might be the MOST Jets team I've ever seen.
    We won that’s all that matters to me they did the same thing to the Bills it happens 🤷🏽
    I cannot understand year in and year out there is serious injuries all across the offensive line. Mehki Becton had a really bad game too
    I am so sick and tired of these Achilles injuries it’s ridiculous
    One big thing was the refs not deciding the game!
    Incredible D...Awful O...Great kicker...
    After those injuries that's def some grit same to giants but somebody had to win.
    Asked if "this was sustainable", Saleh says "playing great defense is sustainable". Great defense? This "great" defense allowed over 200 yards rushing to a one dimension team. Especially once Taylor went out, everyone on planet Earth knew they were running the ball every down and they still couldn't stop him. This defense has a LONG way to go to be called great. Also, Zach Wilson can't hide an entire game of horrible play with a few good throws. He takes sacks that my 10 year old wouldn't take. Loss of 10, loss of 15, loss of 15 again, loss of 10 again. He had more yards going backwards than the entire offense of the Giants had going fowards. Add two lost fumbles and he's right back to sucking as always. All you Zach Wilson fans can bite my a**, he sucks. Period. We MAY be able to win 6 more games, but that's a big if and even then I don't think we make the playoffs with a 10-7 record. We'll see what happens.
    Go Jets🎉
    Someone should have told the defense that when the last quarterback is playing (maybe their fourth string) that if you breathe on him they will throw the flag. The NFL with no one able to play quarterback is unmarketable. And number 18 and number 10 do not add up to 84. They don't get open enough. Why didn't the Jet's ask Corey Davis to come back after Rogers went down?
    YA CAN TELL THE GIANTS ... IT'S THE WAY THE BALL BOUNCES EVERYTHING WENT THE JETS WAY AT THE END OF REGULATION ....AND IN OT...
    You get wins you don't deserve and lose games you deserve to win. This is the W we didn't get for the Pats or Chiefs game. They need to figure out how to let Zach play off schedule ... he doesn't stand a chance in a set offense. The sack at the end was not on him. He has one receiver going the direction AWAY from the best pass rusher on the Giants. Its a HORRIBLE play call
    Zach needs to start slinging the rock. We need another WR if Davis didn’t retire we would be way better
    BRING IT !!!
    I don't mind losing, but not to the GIANTS.
    Amazing win
    I've been hearing about cleaning up penalties for 3 years. No discipline. Zach still stinks.
    In next years draft, the Jets better draft at least 5 OL players🙄
    Aaron Rodgers is going to be ready next week.
    NYJ should give the game ball to NYG General Manager.
    GIANTS GAVE THEM.THE GAME!! BUT THATS OK JETS AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE
    Giants show grit too, you taught you was coming to row over us, you lucky we had a third string QB 😂😂😂😂
    the fact that Jets coaching staff and fan base is happy after a win like this just goes to show you just how poverty they are.
    Tiki Barber, during the broadcast made mention of the turf being the cause of several injuries on a succession of plays. He then quickly withdrew his comment. I wonder who from the Jets, Giants or the NFL told him to walk back his statement. We’ve already lost Rodgers. Do something about that turf! There is no reason to have artificial turf in an outdoor stadium in New York.
    Aint no way a team like the chiefs don't destroy the giants man coverage defense , even if the defense are playing good coverage , a good qb will throw it to the 1 on 1 matchups instead of taking sacks.. can't expect the jets defense to cover the bullshit mistakes and inability to score offense touchdowns every game
    Bro Giants gifted Jets win, just say what it is coach, no shame.
    Can we call Al Woodall? However.....still on the way to my 10-7 season total and round one playoff loss.
    Ugly af… BUT… winning is winning! #Jets #TakeFlight 🛫🛫✈️✈️✈️
    Get grass instead of turf! Ridiculous so many injuries on both teams! Knees and Achilles tears. C'mon Mr. Johnson it's gotten out of hand! Ugly win, I'll take eem! A win is a win!
    Hackett said be ruthless when they get injured then they do then they get injured listening to him good make things even the Jets have every right to do the same thing what goes around comes around🌺🌺🌺🌺
    Change QB's for 3rd down. Put in someone who can complete a 5 yard pass.
    If Zach is a back up QB then the line needs to be a bunch of back ups, oh wait they are.
    How long do you get say WE NEED TO GET BETTER. 7 Games has past 7 more season over. Saleh protects Zack more than any coaoch with Any player ever!!!!
    Coaching is bad penalties almost cost you game against a team with -8 passing yards. Lazard should’ve been told to get down after that catch hand ball to refs. Lucky 1 second left to spike ball. Situational awareness needs taught by coaching. Keep hearing same thing about Zach 3rd down not improving putting points up not improving how long before we see improvement
    Jet's win 🙏🏆💚🤍💚💚
    You almost lost to a QB that didn’t throw one pass, since the 2nd qrt and this is after a bye week, what an Effin joke! 2 of 15 third down conversions? I’m a realistic Jet fan, and as much as this hurts. This is a 2-5 team really.
    Winning lucky won’t last. Zach will only go so far.
    COACH!!
    This team is nearly impossible to watch. Defense is elite but the offense is the worst thing I've seen on the field since my peewee football team that went 0-8
    The O=line is the problem...except for "Big Ticket".
    A win i s a win GMen did nothing with the turnovers. Lol
    Great win but Hack deciding to pass it on three straight 3rd and 1 downs was awful and painful to watch. I get you're down a couple lineman, but line up and smash it forward especially in those conditions. That drove me more nuts than the penalties.
    The Giants lost the game. The Jets did not win it.
    Neither team deserved to win this game. Kicker almost blew the fg in OT too.
    4 wins 3 Achilles tears
    Salah your 4 and 3 the offensive game should be clicking by now! Zack is a problem and you know it!
    We need to be better... Jeremiah 29:11 - For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. God bless! Jesus is the way and saves! Psalms 62✝🤍💪
    Pretty or uuuuuuugly, a win is a win!
    am i the only one that has to turn my tv volume to 90 to hear this? Every other video is normal and its every week on the press conference.
    Needing things to fix for 3 years.
    This staff is so delusional 😢
    The Giants throw for no efun yards and still almost win the game!
    We sacrifice another Achilles to the football gods. AAAAHHHHOOOOOOOOMMMMMM......
    Zach 2 great job 👏
    Good for wilson!!!!
    How about some accountability for the beyond DUMB mistakes.. Offsides on punt from end zone ? Really??? Equivalent to a turnover
    Saleh got away with this one. Unacceptable we came out of the bye looking worse yet again.`,

    This is such a painful press conference to watch. Saleh is such a good dude and coach. He’s gotta feel like he just got beat up.
    Saleh is being professional in this post game press conference, however, look at his faces during the game to tell how he really thinks about what happened. Zack continuously did not climb up in the pocket during his drop backs and got sacked at least four times because of it. Zack really needs to learn some basics about how to evade the rush. It was not all his fault but he definitely killed most of the momentum during the game which proved pivotal in terms of the Chargers controlling the narrative. The long sacks that took us out of field goal position, the fumbles. TRASH
    Hackett didn’t think he’d actually have to call plays this year.
    Stroud has looked better than Zach ever has.. Dobbs brand new team looked better yesterday. Enough!
    Man I feel for y'all Jets fans.. Don't give up on this man though he seems like a great coach. Just needs a quarterback.
    Over 10 drops, penalties, turnovers. Not Zachs fault. Pretty embarrassing considering they had 2 WEEKS to prepare and set the tone for the 2nd half of the season and go on a playoff run. That looks unlikely now. This is the NY Jets we know and this is their DNA.
    It's everyone's job to score, true. It's the OC's job to lead tho & the QB's job to make those around him better. And when that doesnt happen, the Offense looks like this.
    I’ve seen enough of Zach. Had a chance to get a legit backup when Rodgers went down and we knew Zach was the guy. we have no one legit to come in to spark the team so it’s Zach or bust right now. And let’s be honest here. If Rodgers was playing the offense would be better but this line is not helping and the play calling is atrocious. Starting to see why Hackett was one and done in Denver. Lazard needs to be better. This was a gut punch for sure.
    Uzama was so unused to catching TDs, he was surprised he had one in his hands; so he dropped it.
    Zach had to step up today. Avoid the sacks, fumbles, make plays with your feet in extending plays. Should’ve kept White. He’s the backup for Miami now, with a concussion-prone starter.
    Went to my first nfl game tonight. Biggest or only moment worth cheering for was the player introductions
    Too much dead weight.. Lazard, Cobb, Cook. We only have 1 legitimate receiver. But ever since McGovern went down.. the team has been sinking. I don’t think thats a coincidence. I can’t blame everything on oline but they certainly didn’t help. I’m sure they’re all frustrated right now but they were all professional and didn’t lose their cool which is admirable aside from that moment Garret was jarring at someone for who knows what. I think we need to trade fireman Ed for that Chargers Super fan. Perhaos we’d have better luck.
    I’d say the chargers defense is better but the world won’t say that. Even though they did what the jets couldn’t do this game a they took the ball away and hit hard and played fast .
    The game begins and ends with QB play!
    This reminds me of when Rex had to defend Sanchez every week saying he had a great week in practice and "its gonna turn around" only its much worse... 8 touchdowns in 8 games, 7 if you count Philly. Garrett and Breece are our only offense.
    What did we expect to be honest? We been watching the same thing for weeks. We knew that the defense was going to have to score 1 to 2 tds for us to win.
    How does Mecole end up in the dog house, and Lazard is just fine, madness
    Jets management has to listen to troy aikman and the truth he had to say. Hopefully they finally learn and make some changes.
    Can’t but feel like the Rodgers trade is crushing us. Forced us to get Lazard, Cobb, Boyle, and Hackett. Can’t fire any of them as it’s a risk you piss Rodgers off. Has us completely by the balls and cost us a season now. Feels like Joe D knew this and punted trade deadline as well. This season turning into another copium filled jets year.
    Robert really doing his best as a coach and man to answer every question so professionally. Shout out to Saleh man.
    My guess is Rodgers is heading back to Cali saying “screw this” “i’ll see you guys next year”
    Saleh literally is loss of words for this press conference…can’t explain why Wilson is playing the way he is.
    A great coach doesn’t say give me the greatest quarterback ever and we’ll make the playoffs. We’ll win a Super Bowl. You gotta win with what you got or get rid of it.
    This guys says “ for the most part I feel like we did a pretty good job”
    Zach and Lazard both really sucked today.. this offense might be the worse we have ever seen.. what a shame when we have this amazing defense
    How can this be a step back for zach? He's as far back as he can go already
    Feels like 2022 all over again 🤔
    The fact that he refuses to consider a QB change is mind boggling.
    I'm getting tired of hearing Saleh's BS. Bench, fire or cut somebody for crying out loud. Just do anything to shake things up, this O needs it.
    We watched the failure of the entire offense today. Garrett and Breece are dogs but that Jamal Adams syndrome is starting to seep in over there. We need another dog to step up but let's go crush the Raiders ✈️
    63 yards rushing tonight is miserable.
    Being a fan of this team takes 20 years off your lifespan it’s sad.
    14 years of high hopes and the same outcome every season..
    Whole team failed. My god was the right side of the line completely abysmal. Zach needs to realize that and get the ball out faster. And goddamn can they have a good play without it getting called back
    Nice try. I hope you’ll win the next game.🏈Let’s go J-E-T-S!
    He said it’s not even close to his worst game!!!! Wowwwwwww wtf????? Are we joking
    This offense with ZW is an embarrassment
    Why are the Jets so committed to Zach Wilson? Can someone ask that question? Why is he immune to being benched for poor play?
    Robert was looking pissed out there, Can't blame him
    This offense is a bottom three offense and this head coach has yet to bench anyone or call out anyone. It’s the same old crap of “It’ll get better”
    Defense A+ Offense D-
    No tweets from Namath last night. This offense is so horrific even Joe has given up..
    I can't defend this guy anymore. Big arm, athletic but obviously something going on between the ears to keep making the same mistakes. TEAMSEMION
    What game was he watching? 8 sacks but for most part they did well, They ran well? Lack of discipline is shocking. 3 years in this coaching staff still can't be honest about how poor they are at offense. Zach not worth much thought. I feel bad for defense and a couple of offensive players.
    Zach and Saleh need to be shown the door, not at the end of the season - right now. Hackett should be booted as well. I’m not counting on the Jets front office to do it either given their stubbornness. Either Boyle or Siemian should take over. I was actually rooting for Wilson not to score on the final drive as they were dinking and dunking to try to pad his stats.
    So many Preset Penalties... Never any Roll-out passes... Carelessness with the ball... Lack of QB Awareness in the pocket... Barely any Chip Blocks on Bosa or Mack all game long... POOR COACHING AND PREPARATION!... Sign Yours Truly~ 2023 New York Jets
    All this crap about Zach gives us the best chance to win is getting old.Our OC is garbage.All he wants to do is dink and dunk down the field.I have never seen a team with so many 3rd and 5,and 3 and 12 in my life.
    Play Trevor at QB, put in Brownlee at WR, send Lazard home tell him we'll call when needed just stay home, let anybody besides Hackett call plays, it cant get worst.
    Said it once, I'll say it again. I don't know why he rides with ZW so much. He holds on to the ball way too long. Things won't get better with him under center, plain and simple. That said, the dropped balls were terrible. Lazard couldn't catch a cold and same with Breece.
    Mike White would’ve won that game last night, I bet my house on it.
    REMEMBER THOUGH, ZACH WILSON LOOKS GREAT IN PRACTICE!
    The overall offensive weapons on this team aren’t that good outside of GW and BHall. They don’t really have a 2nd or 3rd receiver and the TE’s aren’t very good and the OLine is terrible. Zach has improved but they don’t set him up for success at all
    Too many injuries, penalties, and dropped balls as usual.
    it was a weird game..you feel like if they didnt get that early punt return it could have been a lot closer..they were always behind the 8 ball..chargers total offence 190 yards
    Robert really looking pissed out there I can’t blame him , that was just absolute dog shit rough
    Jets scorecard: Defense = B Offense = F Special team. = C
    Sorry to say this but been a NY Jet fan since 1972. I have seen this time and time again. We are going no where. Time for a change .
    That game was embarrassing. All we did was shoot ourselves in the foot for 60 minutes in a must win game. Disgraceful and disgusting
    Saleh has no control over the QB situation. I’m telling you he hates it as much as the fans do but Woody has his hands tied.
    Let’s not forget Zach Wilson was number 3 behind Flacco n white
    Zak’s not getting it done.Pit Siemian in,shake it up
    It’s all Zach’s fault. He needs to block better, run better, catch passes better, quit jumping the snap, and call better plays. He sucks, and once Rodgers returns, all our problems will be solved.
    Jets staff members hate to realize they draft pick Zach Wilson is a bust smh 🤦
    Zach is who we think he is!!!! Best he can do is kick field goals. It’s time to move on common man. 49ers did it with Trey Lance. It’s ok to admit y’all fucked up drafting Zach!
    We have seen enough of zw. Let's start trevor next week. Can't be any worse
    I really thought we had a good roster this year and not to take anything away from the defense but Offensively they should give back some money with the last 9wk of crap that they have shown horrible I pay good money to go to these games smh
    The offensive line played worse at their job than Zach did at qb
    Oline atrocious, penalties and dropped balls. It wasn’t all ZW fault BUT he does not fit this system. If the raiders can bench Garapolo I would not rule out benching Zach for the sake of having a more system friendly qb like Boyle or Siemen ☠️ ✈️
    Zach Wilson is going to cost Robert’s job!
    Other QB's with less experience adjust to their surroundings in less time its getting sad
    Jets media are some of the worst reporters in all of sports. Some of the worst questions. Do they even understand the game of football?
    Jets should be embarrass all of the hype and hoopla before the game Offense was atrocious zach played like a scared rookie Turn overs Wilson non chalant with ball Zach doing his Dan Jones impersonation losing the ball or holding on to the ball too long Offensive coordinator play calling was aweful Defense was average charges pretty much did anything they wanted Special teams were horrible Same old jets disgraceful
    our offense is playing so bad were basically scoring FOR the other team. defense is playing great as always. the offense just put them in awful positions.
    Watching the Jets hurts my eyes
    Saleh is terrible, but he'll be here through 2024.
    Just here to hear what excuses he has this week. Wait…Wilson just took another sack at a crucial moment. I have news, even with ARod, this offense is not winning any Superbowls. Two great offensive players can’t carry an entire offense. Meanwhile Stroud just threw another touchdown.
    True… but he was playing with arguably less weapons and worse defense n coach
    Everyone is saying Zach is the problem but if I'm not mistaken it's a team, The team as a whole failed
    Raiders got a new quarterback who’s good. NY Giants got smoked. Zach didn’t take sacks……. He took BAAAAADD SACKS!!!!! Bad fumbles. Turkeys for Thanksgiving!!!!!
    6 POINTS.. 6 FREAKIN POINTS.. 6!!!
    If Rodgers somehow plays this season he won’t last the game the way they got at Wilson Rodgers will get a career injury so why even play him with the Jets offensive line ?
    Coach cant even find the words. He's Fuming inside
    The offense clearly needs a spark. Time for a swap. Either brownlee for lazard. Izzy for dalvin. Tood downing for hackett. Or trevor for zack. Also put mitchell back at tackle. Thats not even a choice
    It's you Saleh, week after week your team is not ready to play.Simple things like dumb penalties. Alignment.Dropped balls, Lazzard should be benched and his spot given to someone else.It's on you the head coach.
    We shot ourselves about 4 times tonight!! Cnt win games like that we cud bin way ahead of the bills if we won!
    No one can tell me Zach is not the problem.I watch a lot of games on Sunday and teams move the ball,even the bad quarterbacks in the league can move the ball down the field.This has to be the worst offense Ive ever seen.Saleh must go too,with all his bs.Jet fans deserve better than this!
    Zach, Hackett, saleh gotta go
    The team as a whole lost this game. Too many stupid mistakes, penalties, drops......overall was a very sloppy game. We clearly took a huge step back. SMH
    Is hacket now the NFL version of Iowa’s Brian Ferentz and the nepotism is with him being Rodgers guy?
    In the 2023 nfl you need to be able to put up 3 offensive tds a game minimum what are we doing?
    There is nothing bazaar about the game tonight. It's the same thing we've watched for 2+ years with Zach. Love Saleh but enabling Zach to continue to act like he's a QB has already gotten his best friend's brother fired.
    Hey Woody, time to pull the plug on this bunch the same way Davis did in Las Vegas. Bench Wilson. Fire Saleh and Douglas.
    Too many bad players on offense. Only players that didn't kill the jets on offense were breece hall and joe Tippmann. Maybe you can include gipson and Conklin. Garret Wilson fumble took away 3 points, Zach's fumbles were killer, laken was pushed around, becton couldn't keep up, Mitchell and Turner rolled out the red carpet to Zach. Lazard was atrocious. Uzomah bad as usual, Ruckert with a bad penalty. Cook is so bad. Michael Carter was ok for his minimal role. Need health from oline (McGovern and Schweitzer can help a bit) need to play Ruckert more than uzomah, need to try out brownlee who may be able to get a one on one contested catch which no one seems to be able to do. Need to make Conklin a central point of the passing attack.
    Saleh continues losing credibility each week defending Zach Wilson, who is not a NFL QB. Also the Zach Wilson defenders are like a crazy cult. So no matter how bad Zach plays in the game. It's always someone elses fault. SMH
    Wishing he had Josh Dobbs
    Zach dropped 263 yards today LFG
    I don’t understand when jets fans say bad things about saleh. Last year they had too 5 defense and no one was saying that before the season. This year you can look at what they did to Herbert mahomes hurts and Allen. After this game they have a top ten defense. A coaches specialty is typical one side of the ball and he has them playing on defense. Ppl be son emotional but the team offense sucks tho lol
    The entire team failed here. It looked like they werent prepered at all for this game. A lot of good players werent used the way they should... i mean, lets say Cook... tell me one good thing he did with the ball, just one. Lazard, maybe lil bit more but again. They look like rookies which brings me back to the statement the entire team failed. What the hell is wrong this coaches and game calls. Look at that poor atempts on run, they are literally jets - banging themselves into damn walls like they are blind and brainless... was the game call - just run like hell where the f ever you want something would happen, throw the ball the same way. its football time its football time sadness...
    Saleh needs to bench Zach before he gets fired`,

    contents: `That hail mary throw was insane. I think Garrett would have caught that if Conklin didn't get a PBU on it
    I think a lot of it has to do with the offense not being able to get in a groove from the penalties and Saleh making them play way too conservative for the first 50 minutes of the game. They scored a TD and had other big plays taken away by penalties tonight, it really comes down to the coaching when it happens this often, game after game, imo
    The only coach I wanna keep on this staff is Ulbrich. Saleh & Hackett can go
    Robert Saleh is 15-28. Antonio Pierce is 2-0. Let's get him
    🤣🤣 Gase is playing a sick trick on us lol 😆 I'm not mad that we lost this game, I've been a Jets fan long enough to know this outcome is what's supposed to happen.
    The Jets committed to the Rodgers plan by bringing him in along with Lazard/Cobb, Hack, etc. This team was built for Aaron. When he went down the season was over.
    The interception was on was on Lazard. He didn’t come back for the ball. He was waiting for the ball instead of stepping up and catching it.
    The penalties and the lack of innovation with play calling is unacceptable! Last year the OC was the scapegoat well this year it all has to point back to Saleh! Joe has put a lot of talent on this team despite his inability to build a solid offensive line (injuries don’t help) but I honestly feel like coaching is the issue now.
    We're lucky if we win another game the rest of the season. TDs have become unicorns. Saleh's seat must surely be getting hot, because it's no longer just about cabbage-head Zach. The troubles are much more extensive. Already looking forward to the 2024 season.
    This is the definition of insanity and also the definition of how to lose a team in the process
    Please keep this coach 😂 I’m sure the division has no issues with it lol
    Bench Uzomah, bench Lazard, fire Hackett-Saleh can't override Rodger's wishes to keep them
    I thought Zach played fine. A few bad throws and a INT but was connecting a good bit and climbing the field. This end zone thing the Jets have going on is insane though and the constant penalties make it hurt even more, critical plays getting reversed every drive.
    My game ball goes to Marc Davis for having the guts to fire John McMuffin mid-season. Pierce looks like a winner who will shake off the interim title. Our guy? Not looking like a winner. And we have two and a half seasons worth of sampling.
    It's Saleh's third year, isn't this when coaches start to experience something of a success?
    Zack played good. The penalties and no run game lost that game for the Jets.
    He had 3-4 years to figure it out. He has to go. Guy is sticking with ZW and trying to convince people that he’s getting better. Sad part is he’ll be back next season
    Love how quick people are to blame everything on Zach like he's the only one on the team
    Joe Namath was right! Jets need a change from top to bottom!!
    THE JETS ARE KILLABLE!!!! Shout out to BT!!!!!
    Love being a Jet fan...
    This offense is a complete embarrassment nothing else needed to be said.
    No us fans have to figure out a better team to watch. I moved to Florida and found Tom Brady and the bucks what a pleasure to watch a team that was never out of a game.
    I think ZW did well. These penalties need to stop. Every time we have something good, they ruin it immediately. Enough is enough. Saleh needs to rip these guys on the field. I’m sick of seeing no emotion from him.
    This is absolutely embarrassing. Fire him!!!
    God awful clock management at the end of the game. Basically let 10 seconds burn off the clock. How do you have 10 coaches on the sideline and none of you are capable of calling a timeout when he catches that 30 yard pass
    Robert thinks the offense is doing alright with 8 touchdowns in 9 games. Get me a case of what he’s drinking
    Saleh has to make Head coaching decision, problem here is he can't get his head out of the defense, he is a coordinator, the attention giving to the defense line should have been given to the offense line, but he wants more defense players, start with changing the play caller, like a head coach would, bench the players that need to be benched, you know who they are.
    Saleh should be required to re-listen to his post-game interviews. He makes the same sad statements over and over and over again. He makes the same damn excuses for Zach EVERY WEEK. "He's not far off, he did some good things, it's not Zach it's the whole operation, we just missed some opportunities, we moved the ball at times, but just couldn't punch it in", etc, etc, etc. Geez. The same statements. For three years. Who sticks with a qb this bad for three years?? What a joke of an organization.
    It is malpractice to not fire Hackett at this point
    Zach needs to play like that all game. A pick is ok if u throw 2TD
    The jets lost that game when they started 3 straight drives inside the 15 in the 3rd quarter. They literally tried to return the kickoff which is hardly ever a good idea and the returner gets stuffed at the 12 yard line. The jets look horribly coached and couldn’t get out of their own way.
    Like Troy said bad team with a great defense. Then comes the penalties on offense with all the holds. They don't care or don't know how to block. Lazard is awful. I'm not blaming nothing on Zack, except for the interception I thought he did a decent job. Most of the blame is Hackett-Saleh. I don't see anything approving, Saleh keeps saying the same thing like a broken record player. The punter for the Jets after the game must have a sore leg with all the punts he has to kick and the defense that has to be on the field most of the game. I really respect the jets defense.
    4:40 the deep breath and the "I don't know" tells you everything you need to know...
    1.5 more seasons of this guy.
    Nothing you say Saleh will make any Jets fan feel better, props to you for being a professional, maybe it's time to leave. I'm so heartbroken it's actually effecting my mood, ruined the start of the holiday season I'm telling you
    I’d really like to hear some accountability for a change
    Would be nice to HEAR THE QUESTIONS!!!! Zero accountability on this team ZERO! UZOMAH should be benched next game, his undisciplined play cost us this game! Bench Lazard for mailing it in, his lazy routes are a joke. We have young guns dying to see the field
    I totally agree everything you said 1180 I been saying the same thing I blame head coach gotta try a different QB and t least see what you have doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results is the definition of insanity will rober Saleh is insane because they do the same shit so they deserve to lose
    Why didn't Joe Douglas sign a veteran backup QB ?
    The Vikings and Raiders are winning with their third string QBs. Let that be known. A change was needed and they responded. I smell conflict of interest with this Jets organization and it shouldnt take patriarchs like Joe Namath to call them out. Is it true Zach Wilson is related to someone who is a top.exec at JetBlue and sits on the board with Woody Johnson somewhere? Is this where we are?
    Although he wasn’t great you can blame Zach for all the stupid penalties the lack of getting open and catching the ball. Also if our Oline get open a hole for Breece or any back on 3rd and 1 or less when every other team can even against our D that should tell us something.
    Worst thing Saleh didn’t do is pound the table for a good backup. Should have forced Joe D & Woody. We know what Zach is, we all so it last year & year before. Whole team is better, except two places online, QB.
    I think no matter who’s under center, I think they lose this game. The line is as horrible the qb. Lazard is also horrible. Running back Garret Wilson and the defense are the only thing that holds the team together
    Saleh is covering for higher-ups or Rodgers. There are clearly problems @ higher levels.
    Anything is possible with A-Rod. I remember last year the packers had a 2% chance of making the playoffs and came up a game short to the lions. Don't count out the jets just yet
    Can a jets fan help me understand why Zach Wilson is still the QB?
    Since every possession ends up with 3rd and 20, shouldn't we have a whole playbook for 3rd and 20 calls. We already know that every 2nd and 10 is a run up the middle to give us 3rd and 12, so perhaps we should stop running on 2nd and 10. Either commit to the pass for a whole possession, or run on every down.
    And when Minn loses QB to injury they immediately bring in Dobbs who last two weeks has 5 TDs. Even if Zack turned corner and started throwing TDs which we all hope is the case - what happens if he goes down … u couldn’t trade a 6th pick for Dobbs? Then have CJ two dumb penalties cost jets TD… JFM with another Rouging passer penalty.., Why are u taking breece off field 3rd down? He can break a run on a check down at any point- instead u bring in Michael carter for dumb penalty - when he not dropping ball. Lack of discipline -on coach Lack of viable bavk up - on JD Won’t matter if AR comes back
    Yea, bro. Robert Saleh had a cocky smirk on his face at half time. You don't look so cocky now.
    Saleh has a nice whisper voice... I hire him to be my ASMR sleeping coach 💤
    Coaching, play calling and penalties is what lost us this game WAYYYYYYYYYYYY more than Zach… when u see the same type of awful penalties for what 3 games in a row????? Maybe more, thats on coaching and it’s just sickening.. 2 touchdowns called back… we are always moving back on the field and just playing scared all game, until we have no choice but to play at the end, is just getting so freaking old and annoying.. its crazy how they keep doing the same shit and making no changes.. its so obvious what happens and we all see it.. crazy thing is to, anytime they do not play scared and let Zach throw it, he actually looks pretty damn good but unfortunately they only do it, when its already to late in the game and we are trying to play catch up and desperate.. i am over it and the season is OVER Btw remember when this guy kept saying how close we were on offense??? lol that would be his excuse after every game and we have been even worse since he kept saying that… man i am just so freaking over it.. i already knew the season was over before this game but now its really over
    Fire Saleh ‼️
    Zack did ok can’t Blame him it’s a team sport everybody gotta get better ❤️‍🩹
    Disappointed with this interview. But I guess I shouldn’t be. They were something like for 3 for 17 on their last 3rd down or less than 3 yards why doesn’t he explain that or how the defence gave up 160 yards on the ground instead of saying they are an elite championship defence.
    Please teach Cj how to block, sold us Twice.
    If your QB can’t get it into the end zone for 60 minutes, he needs to go..freakin Temu Qb
    Not with that coaching staff. It’s on Saleh and JD for the disfunction. If you can’t see where you went wrong. You’re totally not right for that position
    11 Quarters, only Field Goals, No Touchdowns
    Inexcusable what Saleh is doing. He is not willing to make a change at QB while his defense plays their hearts out. He is willing to risk the entire season for Zack Wilson. Terrible coaching job this season with the constant penalties and his support of Wilson.
    i couldnt tell from this presser, are the jets moving the ball?
    As a coach ur suppose to get ur guys mentally ready on Sunday and yet there getting a flag every good play they get. So much for the “Gold Zone” when we can’t even score !!!
    They need to clean house like the Raiders did! Hackett’s offense is from the 1970s, JD is too stubborn to sign a backup QB like Dobb’s and Saleh is a great DC , but doesn’t get the entire picture of running the whole team. Get rid of them all .
    What are we even watching week to week anymore. I can’t even enjoy the games because the whole 60 minutes is a headache. The whole team looks lost from top to bottom and when the team is lost… so is the season. We need to make big BIG changes
    Joe D and Saleh are unwilling or unable to fix a historically bad offense and another season has been flushed down the toliet. Are these the right guys to lead this team?
    No leadership on oc coaching or the huddle. Have to bench Wilson for a spark. The raiders did it
    He’s so delusional. Zach Wilson must have some dirt on him because there’s no way you can say “he’s playing pretty well” when the product on the field is so poor. Put Saleh in a padded room because he’s lost his mind and possibly some of the locker room as well
    Idk how this will go but should have never fired LeFleur.
    Season is over, I can't see this team ever winning in my lifetime. Maybe great players will want to play for the jets if they get a stadium of like in New York. But another season lost.
    I’VE GOT HIS BACK!!!
    There have got to be players on this team involved in POINT SHAVING... It is impossible for this team to keep committing these backbreaking penalties that kill their drives again and again. I think the Feds should be called in to investigate this, I'm not kidding, there are players on this team sabotaging the game and they must be involved with organized crime in a Point Shaving scheme.
    He needs to go geesh
    How about putting in a backup center to play for Wilson. Or bench entire offense except Hall.
    how many drops and penalties for Zach to throw 3rd and 20 and terrible run run, Zach try to bail out pass on 20 yard penalty throws after lazard and uzomah drop every pass and no o line. Watch the game, has the talent, can throw the heck out of it, has the legs, learning to make quick decisions (has to with these 8th string o line) yes not perfect and hold on long sometimes but that's what gives potential for that (shoulda been touchdown) run he had or the ability to even make that pass at the end. Watch the game dude, runs for his life, Rodgers injured cause a more healthy online than Zach has was still crappy, terrible play calling, run, run, pass, so conservative, Garret Wilson even missed deep ball and a third down 20 yard dot tonight, but blame Zach for those penalties and drops and bad play calling, wish he was a 49er and a champion by now, jets are a worthless franchise🖕
    Just... win.. baby
    Anyone that’s blaming the loss on Zach needs glasses and a lobotomy ! Zach played well enough to win the game but when you have the same penalties game after game by the same players and there’s no accountability, what are you gonna do 🤷‍♂️ Don’t forget the dropped passes and there were how many of them ? 🤷‍♂️
    Nxt yr, the offense will be competent but the D will be the problem nxt season, I just kno it
    Rogers comes back would be not a good move it’s over jets fans maybe next year
    Love Saleh but he would be getting fired if not for Aaron coming back. Sticking with Zach and thinking the O played good is ... SMH! With Josh Dobbs we win this game and last week by 20
    “Stay Humble”
    Also I would like to apologize to Mike LaFleur 🙏🏾 it's wasn't your fault after all my guy...
    It's weird that the Jets repost the same Saleh video after every game. It's this supposed to be different for every game?
    Saleh faith in Zach will be the reason he gets fired
    Players need to start getting benched for their stupidity and laziness on blocking. Potentially 14 points taken off the board because of it. Lazard needs to be benched. Can’t catch or run routes.
    So once again Saleh what picture from this game is going on the wall in the hallway this week?
    Season is over thanks again jets you seem to invent new ways to be unsuccessful every year its fantastic to witness another season go down the cr*phole. But Woodys email asking for payments for next years season ticket came through successfully.
    I will help you, start 5 o-line players who are on your 2024 roster. Draft Jj MCCARTHY after a trade down or draft Penix or Jayden Daniels after a trade up. Draft 3 o-linemen. Trade for a young WR. Cut Zach
    Rodgers thinks he’ll comeback in Dec Yeah ok This team will be done in the next few weeks
    Sorry to say it Saleh, Zach and the offense our about to have you nailed to a cross. This offensive performance consistency is appalling.
    Start Pulling the Repeat Penalty Offenders!!
    Saleh would be a good defensive coordinator, he’s a poor head coach.
    the offensive penalties were inexcusable,they need to clean house in this organization, haven’t had a legitimate contending team since 2009-2010
    How about benching a freaking player Robert? How about Uzomah. He deserves to be benched. And you look weak as hell for not grabbing him by the helmet and benching him in front of his players to set the example that mediocrity will not be tolerated. This team has become a joke, again.
    Same tired lines, over and over and over and nothing changes. “Find a way”…it’s mid season, you haven’t got it
    Zack didn't lose this game, the horrible penalties lost this game.
    Weve been losing since the beard, it has got to go
    Offensive line still need work, line man need to get conditioning
    Watching Zach Wilson hurts. Lol
    This offense is inept!!!! Why won’t this team make any changes??? Wtf is going on with this organization, playcaller needs to change!!
    Put another QB in there and see what happens. I don't care who`,

    Saleh and Hackett and Joe Douglas were all counting on Rogers to carry the offense and fix everything. They’ve been caught with their pants down and have been exposed and the D will start to feel it now. I can’t believe the D has remained this stout for a year and a half of this absolute hot garbage on offense. Another top 5 pick coming fellas.
    If I have to hear "we're gonna watch the tape" one more time😤
    No depth on the offensive line. It's amazing how this has been a problem for years and STILL never has been addressed. Injuries are an expected part of the game. You can't say oh we have AVT and Becton, we're fine. It's next man up and there's no one behind them.
    It will be nice if Saleh shows the same seriousness he shows at every post game conference, in the game field to win games!
    Watch the tape, repeat, battle to lose, and not finding ways to be successful, trying to find ways, their young, this is becoming the JETS new motto!
    Saleh is proof that you don't hire an assistant coach to be your head coach because he comes from another head coach's successful system. Salah has gone backwards with developing this team in all 3 phases.
    No one's fault except for o-line honestly... Our o line is trash and Zac gets pressured every snap. Also Lazard has not been producing at all
    The guy who used to say “Time to make the donuts” had more emotion than Saleh here
    Denver will end up with a better record than the Jets! Nothing else needs to be said. That’s a fireable offense in itself after acting like Sean Payton stepped out of line disparaging the awful Hackett offense.
    Give credit to Buffalo 😂, I was waiting for that one! Every loss, give credit, they are more talented, better coached!
    one of the best qb’s in the league by far
    Jets stunk it up!!
    Jets need a whole new O-Line, Solid #2 Wide Receiver and Rodgers.
    For the love of God, please run more double TE formations with Conklin and Ruckert and utilize more play action and motion within that formation to help the QB. You need help with blocking and that’s probably the best way to do it for now until the line gets healthy.
    For those saying it, Saleh and Hackett are NOT getting fired as long as Rodgers is on this team. AR will pout and demand a trade if his boys especially NH get let go.
    I guess that whole Michael Cater cutting and inserting Izzy for big things wasn't just a distraction for the coaching failure. One run play, one passing play. This Head Coach is a machine. A BS machine.
    FIRE SALEH!!!
    Rodgers is part of the problem—he brought in his friends Hackett and Boyle, and now they’re stuck with them.
    Hackett must go
    Saleh is a great coach. There is not a coach that can manage a team without a quarterback and an offensive line. Joe Douglas needs to step up to the plate.
    We ACTUALLY might have the worst run game in the NFL
    WE need routes to develop in 2 seconds we don’t have time!!
    The once promising season has come to an abrupt end. Watching this team is painful. The stupidity of making no adjustments or changes is appalling SOS Robert it's time for you to go and us to get a real coach and not an appease r.
    New York Jets......NO GAS AND GOOD BRAKES
    When it’s 29-6 there’s hope. I mean it’s a 23-point spread so all you have to do is score three TDs and three two-point conversions — 8 * 3 = 24 — to win. Child’s Play. Kinda like Chucky.
    I get Rodgers was supposed to change everything, but they really were hoping hed just fix EVERYTHING huh
    The defense finally said screw it, it only took ten games, last year it was like 14 or so
    I’ve never in my life seen a Quarterback so coddled. The kids terrible move on please 😢
    I'm just watching for the defense at this point. The offense is shot. Love garrett love breece love all of them but until there's new offensive coordinator that can guide the team there's not gonna be any improvement.
    The O-Line cannot BLOCK for the QB...No QB could survive that O-Line.
    This season ended four plays in, but in typical Jet fashion they had to string a few wins together to get our hopes up and string us out a lil further. This offense is broken, top to bottom. Hackett is the worst offensive coordinator I’ve seen coach for the Jets, perhaps one of the worst I’ve seen period. Zack fucking sucks; holds onto the ball too long, has no pocket presence/awareness, rifles check downs, overthrows receivers, doesn’t use his feet enough and STILL can’t read a field. Our offensive line has been brutalized by injuries for the third year in a row? Can’t run block or pass protect to save its life. Completely useless. Our receivers? Well Garrett is clearly our best one, but even he has been struggling lately; drops, fumbles, etc. Lazard SUCKS. He couldn’t catch a cold in a COVID ward. Cobb should retire and be a WR coach for Christ’s sake. Beyond that? We’re praying on our pick of UDFAs to become the next Wayne Chrebet, not gonna happen. And Douglas? Where has he been at through all of this? Couldn’t trade a sixth rounder for Dobbs? Couldn’t even try to address WR or OL before the deadline? I genuinely think that when he found out Adams and Evans weren’t gonna move, he decided to punt on this season. Every move we’ve made this offseason besides Rodgers and Tippmann sucked. McDonald, no offense to him, had a good showing tonight and I wish him all the best, has barely seen the field this year, which we knew would be the case. We could have drafted JSN to help alleviate our emaciated, pitiful WR room, and instead we drafted a guy who probably won’t play a meaningful game until Year 2 or 3 at a position we’re stacked at. We could have moved up four picks and got a starting caliber OT in Dawand Jones, a first round talent I was pounding the table for at the TOP OF THE SECOND who fell all the way to THE FOURTH, who’s looked excellent for the Browns. Instead we traded back picks, for what? A practice squad TE? A couple of STers? It’s so blatantly obvious that we strutted into this season thinking we were only a Rodgers away from contention, and it’s so painfully obvious now that that isn’t the case. Rodgers can’t make our WRs get open, or learn how to catch a ball, he can’t make our O-line healthy or learn how to block. He’d be doomed by this point as well. I hope they realize that going into next season, assuming anybody on this staff still has a job by then. Fucking Christ
    Very typical of this team getting out coached badly I love how they pit on players
    Zach didn’t complete a pass to a WR! How is that even possible? 🤣🤣
    How about showing some passion ? Some fire? Some anger? I know he doesn’t want to call out players but he lost like he has given up
    Just Endure The Suffering.
    I actually feel bad for Zach. He’s not great but the franchise that drafted him is terrible.
    I haven’t seen anyone mail it in like the Jets since Ted Kaczynski.
    He will stay cause Arod loves him n they don’t want to risk upsetting him n then he retires
    “We’ll get back up off the mat”. Saleh must be listening to old reruns of the WWF because the way this offense is currently set up it would never be good enough for prime time including a lack of accountability.
    Rodgers didn't want a better back-up QB-Zach would never threaten Rodger's supremacy. Jets fans don't get angry enough about Rodger's insistence on Hackett. Rodgers runs the show-not Saleh.
    This team does not appear to be a QB away - can’t stop run/ Wilson WR1 but team has no WR2 (Lazard a 3 or 4) OLine was below ave to start and now throwing warm bodies out there/we have no back up QB ( telling ZW going to sit two years then not having someone to win a key game - what if ARod had to miss a win and your in December game? The plan was to have season depend on ZW? - Lots of work if want to compete next year
    Put Joe Namath in his Prime behind this easily and By Far the Worst O Line In the NFL and would have a bunch of the same problems. An absolute embarrassing Azz Kickin for this group up front yet again..
    Jets got it wrong AGAIN with Him. The whole Rodgers thing blew in their faces because He has to much power and their hands are tied up, they’re stuck with receivers that don’t contribute, an offensive lineman that sucks and one of the worst Head Coaches in History who’s know their offensive coordinator. And they won’t admit to the mistake of drafting Zach Wilson. Cut bait. 49ers gave up a Kings Ransom for Trey Lance and moved on from Him. It comes from the top.
    Watch Zach Wilson go to a Competent franchise in 2024 with good coaching for him flourish. It would not be surprising
    Boyle stinks. But the o line and receivers are just as bad. No qb can succeed with garbage play from the other 10 on offense. Also Hackett is terrible. that has been the one consistent truth
    What was the players only meetings that didn’t get them anywhere?❤❤❤
    The O-line is awful. Isn't this why Aaron Rodgers got hurt? Duane missed the whole block, and the rest is history. They need to fix that O-line cause if they don't, even Rodgers won't be able to help them.
    Saleh has checked out you can clearly see he no longer has answers for anything asked
    Saleh has completely lost control of the team - make Ulbrich HC and fire Hackett so we can be done with this farce
    Fire Hackett, Fire Salah
    Every time the camera is on zach while on the sidelines after every drive, he never is reviewing plays or have any players or coaches discussing what went wrong or how to improve the next drive. 🤔
    Now he changes the qb when the season is over.
    This team needs @ least 5 new, competent O-linemen--they are very expensive. You cannot find most of them through the draft. The Jets & Aaron need to stop the fantasy. He should not play after 2 1/2 months of recovery behind ZERO O-line. They also cannot afford Davante Adams when they need to spend @ least 100+ million on O-linemen. A WR#2 (a real one) will be enough.
    Good stuff coach same old story. No touchdown in four games.
    Well I guess we are going for Draft Picks AGAIN!!! 😢😖😣
    Same ole Jets!
    There's something going on between Joe Douglas and Zach Wilson's mom. That's why Zach keeps playing.
    Questioned his hiring 3 years ago, boy was I right. Saleh should be fired and Wilson traded. Bart, real Jets fan from Oklahoma
    Hey, I’m a lions fan but my family is jersey based. My grandma is a diehard jets fan and has waited a while for the team to be good. Can the jets pls just be a smarter franchise? Is that much to ask?
    Is Saleh still taking receipts
    we gotta find a way to keep lineman healthy. when they are the offense looks fine. but at some point the decimation catches up
    Did he call Josh Allen “Joshua”?!? 😅
    Get well soon actually get players for the O-Line who aren’t soft as wet paper. All of them getting injured. Don’t matter who is QB, when they can’t block anyone. But let’s blame Zack!
    You can watch all the tape you want this team is just a joke at this point. The season isn't slipping away it's actually over so keep doing what your doing at least the Jets will get a good pick 😂😂😅😢😢
    Will Trevor be activated and become the QB2???
    As a Packer fan saleh should be demoted I dont get whats his relationship with zach wilson but he sacrifice the Jets season and great defense .The Jets purposely leak Adams to Jets to district Jets fan
    Buffalo could of came in on a Cot..and Whipped Yall!!
    The O/L is So Bad, we need to consider a 2 Man backfield for blocking- Hall & Cook behind any QB that can Run. Maybe Robert Griffin 3 ? Zach does not have the Moxi/ experience to deal with this line... He is Bait! The other team Defense knows what the Jets will run it seems.
    This game was the beginning of the end for you coach because your team is giving up on you. That all players meeting was about if they should fight or burry you and I think Its very clear what they have chose. Good luck with that.
    1:59 Funniest question ever
    Season over. Tank out and get a high pick so we can get a new QB and build OL.
    the most overused and biggest deflection of taking a look at yourself in professional sports is “hats off” or “give credit” to the other team. this is NOT a game that was won because one team made a superb play. they won because you came in with ZERO game plan and severely underperformed on every level. “give credit to buffalo” would have been warranted if it was a competitive 20-17 game when a great play was made or a timely play was called by the winner. NOT games like this. stop deflecting and own it!
    Someone please tell me how the Gase years were worse? This team is regressing fast and doesnt resemble an nfl franchise.
    Three years he should be a pro, knowing what to do should be up to wear. Aaron knows should be on errands leve so Zach should be on Aaron Rodgers level approval pro a pro quarterback he should be at that level❤❤❤
    You and Hackett and the other dude, not Hackett I’m packing out just you and Douglas❤❤❤
    Josh Allen smoked this guy in San Francisco and again today in Buffalo but trust me the only reason he’s still on board is Rodgers hasn’t given the final say in bringing in his stepdad Nathaniel, but it’s coming soon
    Let's go for draft picks...
    As a bear fan, I come to jets content to make me feel better. It's like the guy with cancer thar goes to those cancer support groups, 😂
    Please start Zach against miami. Sign Robbie Anderson and throw him in the WR room
    He should go back to the 49ers
    If it wasn't for Saleh, we would've completely fell apart since week 1. Us still having a shot is a testiment of his coaching.
    Saying the same thing for the last 3yrs, maybe he's just not cut out to be HC
    Im tired of Saleh Confucius sound bites. His staff is not coaching this team. Hackett is horrible and Im not so sure Rodgers would want to risk his reputation with this team. He just might retire. Cause the offrnsive line is awful in pass blocking and making holes for the RB. We rely on the defense entirely too much. This off season the Jets should sign at least 2 OL and draft 2 more.
    What would you do if someone hire then you would have to get you and the other coach removed for different replacements❤❤❤
    What a mess! The hydration/Gatorade crew was on their game today….that’s about it
    Saleh is a scape-goat-Rodgers is the one insisting on Hackett, Boyle, Turner, Cobb, Lazard.
    Please end this. As a coach and player with huge salaries playing a game you should show more effort on improving. It’s the same script we all need to get better…. Football is all about adversity and most teams figure out how to overcome. The excuses no longer hold merit…
    Yes but a coach that loses Rodgers on game 1 and does not think he needs a qb and an OL after he lost so many … not good
    How do you win with a bad quarterback and we don't have an offensive line. Coach Saleh is doing a great job with what he has in players. G Wilson did not have a game.
    Saleh will be the Lions new DC next season. Time to go home bro.
    be a coach and get in the players face on the sideline. show some emotion coach.
    I HATE the Jets with a flaming passion! But Robert Saleh's a pretty good dude. Quality coach. Worthy adversary. Fuck The Jets, but Robert's alright.
    Buffalo embarrassed us
    Saleh…why did you decided to switch Quarterbacks after a 23 point deficit? Why not after 9?
    honestly its sickening to think how excited and hopeful we were for this season. cant find the words to accurately describe how disappointing all of this has been. its not fair to the fans. the locker room must be absolutely deflated and who can blame them. the defence is great but theyre not getting any help. the sad truth is we’re wasting talent and even with rodgers we wont be good next year. one can try to put all the puzzlepieces together to try and find whos most at fault but in truth there is enough blame to go around. zach, the oline, the wr, hackett ofc etc but most importantly saleh and jd. theyre the one at the top, with the most responsibility and the ones who deserve the most blame. i loved both of them when they got here, and they seem like great ppl, which makes this realization harder. just deflated by all of this. this team is taking my love for football away and with each passing season i believe a little less in us ever being good. its gonna be all the same again. we wont be good next year, everybody will get fired, big turnaround and offseason hype. years of suffering to think now is the time only to ultimately fall short and be disappointed. left looking for excuses and reasons to keep hoping we’ll one day be good. never gonna stop being a jet fan but we dont deserve this and i dont think i can watch any more games for now. if jet fans were rational there would be no jet fans. we are all full of passion and no fanbase in this league can say they suffered like we do. we keep doing this and never get rewarded. i know nobody will read this, but for that one fan who might, youre not alone and remember that theres more to life than football. this team is not worth getting this upset about. for those who bleed green, a superbowl shall never be seen. have a good one you guys and go jets.. “Wake me up when the Jets are good” -Famous last words of a Jet fan
    Saleh -Same script after a lost outcome…
    I might add when the Broncos were coached by Kubiak, Elway brought in Peyton Manning and won a the Super Bowl. Tom Brady went to Tampa Bay with Todd Bowles ans head coach and Tampa won 2 super bowls. Green Bay lost Rodgers and they have lost 6 games. When you have a QB YOU WIN AND WIN.
    Yo reporter said Zach did not make a completion to a wr how is that possible???? 💀
    Make no mistake and don't cater to illusion - the QB is the central problem in all this and has been, now going on 3 seasons. In the case of offensive football, and indeed an entire team, all else flows from there if the QB is incompetent.`,

    As a Giants fan I feel your pain with the offensive line. I don't care if you have Aaron, Patrick, or prime Tom back there, you can't do anything without a serviceable OL. Jets have an incredible defense, but they can only do so much.
    They were getting down the field with Zach. They just couldnt score Tds, but they still were making progress and getting field goals.
    These post games are brutal. He makes Gase look like Bill Parcellicheck
    Penalties and Drops are a reflection on coaches not holding players accountable in practice. Simple as that. He’s gotta go.
    I've been saying for weeks it's not Zach's fault, He was just the scapegoat
    I wish guys like Zach, Garrett, Breece, Conk, and Ruckert at least had a shot in a real offense. A normal sized OL and a real WR2 would go a long way
    Everyone: Blames Zach Zach gets benched: It's Zach fault
    I’ve been putting it on you, Saleh, for weeks. Months. Hell, last two years. The lack of fire or passion on the sidelines when the team screws up. The lack of accountability being held by anyone on the team, which shows on social media when guys like Sauce and Breece and Garrett Wilson throw guys under the bus on Twitter for their own mistakes. The fact Hackett is still in NY calling plays, or at least, still calling slow developing plays behind a very weak o line makes me feel you do not understand the offensive side of the ball. The lack of adjustments made it feels like week to week or at half. The lack of discipline on both sides of the ball. The fact Lazard was still playing even though he has one of the highest drop rates in the NFL of all qualifying receivers (was second last time I looked). The drops period that should be easy completions that can extend drives. The third down conversion %. In fact, the only thing I have applauded you for this year, was not throwing Zach Wilson under the bus for problems he cannot prevent, and yet, still, for the most part, played decent in most games. Until you benched him and made him the scapegoat. I hope today really showed you how Zach carried the o these last 10 weeks, and how you have a serious issue on your offensive line, discipline and play calling resulting in poor play on the offensive side of the ball. I genuinely hope this coaching staff gets fired.
    This is the guy handing out participation trophy's 🏆 and telling everyone they did a good job
    I believe in you NY Jets! Keep your head up!
    I really hope Saleh comes back to the Niners as our DC. 🙏🙏
    No consideration for changing play-callers with a historically bad offense. That is a fireable offense right there
    If we had an OL as good as the defensive line we'd be looking at playoff spots. Zach is sadly not reliable enough - look how quickly Burrow turned things around for the Bengals or how Lawrence settled down to be a playoff contender. I'm starting to think we should have kept White.
    i rooted for saleh since the begining but honestly its ran his course, the mans defeated, lost his fire/passion, and soon will lose the locker room. we need an offense minded coach we have to stop signing defense coordinators as our headcoach. our defenses are always top 15 but our offense is always bottom 3. get bieniemy in here asap if we can, i remember players crying cause his coaching style was to hard/rough during training camp... GOOD he came from a winning culture and thats what he bleeds WINNING id love to have someone like that on our team that i know wants and will get the best out of the team and a coach that will make players/coaches accountable.. i know washingtons record aint great but look at what hes done with howell. imagine him with our weapons and grooming a qb. sadly hell probaly end up taking over for ron eventually
    We believe in you and got your back
    I find it hard to believe that Rogers is really all they are missing. The offense is a mess starting with the O-line, then receivers don’t get open, then the play calling is super predictable. I blame the coaching on the offensive side of the ball.
    Only the Jets could turn the NFL's beloved "Hail Mary" into "What Da F#*K Mary?" 🙃 🤣🤣
    There is no excuse for not playing hard. They gave up on the 99 int return. That's on the coach.
    Would they be better with a healthy Rodgers? Yes. Would they be great with this roster and coaching staff? No Way.
    If you ever feel dumb and useless, just remember the New York Jets exist.
    I honestly think we will never see Rodgers as the Jets QB. His reactions on the sidelines the past few games say, “Why did I decide to come to this inept organization?” I think he’s embarrassed and will retire. I understand that may be a crazy take, but he literally shook his head disgusted tonight.
    Saleh is now 15-30. He needs to go.
    Honestly I just think you guys need one good quarterback a quarterback who can escape the pressure and run out of the pocket and I think you guys would look 10 times better I feel it starts there at least
    Jets = Dumpster Fire. I bet they still blame Zach Wilson for the L. TB was horrible because the entire offense is horrible, including the joke of an OC. 😂
    Saleh needs to be more frank about the problems and show some frustration and fire. He is too matter of fact with no fire in his belly showing. Hackett is surviving because of AR.
    Looking forward to the intro press conference for the new head coach in February.
    You know it really sucks for Selah to keep digging and hoping to do better he's going to have to start changing maybe some of his staff and push staff to push the team in bettering themselves....... ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ My heart and prayers truly go out to selah and the whole jet team but mostly to the coaches they've got a hard job ahead of him and some of it they're not going to like but if they care about anything at all about that team they're going to have to get tough on these guys and push them when they screw up. Otherwise they will continue to have a mediocre and less of a team......it's like you have newbies in offense. And pros in defense. Our defense is totally the life of this team.. You know this sounds crazy but Rogers would be a better offensive caller than any of them there right now at least he knows how it should be ran he might be able to inspire these offensive lineman to step up and do their job because from what I'm seeing right now the staffing groups that they have don't seem to be inspiring these offensive linemen to get tough do their job, and make plays. Jets are better than this.
    If you can't put together a decent O line, it doesn't matter who's behind it. Rodgers himself would have had a crappy record behind them at this point.
    Hackett and the OL are the problems. I watched Zach Wilson at BYU weekly rip opponents apart WITH AN OFFENSIVE LINE THAT COULD BLOCK.
    The end of the Robert Saleh era is upon us
    Jets suck, had a big chance for an actual playoff run this year and it's ruined, you can blame the O-line injuries, you can blame Zach Wilson all you want, but the fact of the matter is that other teams have had injuries just as bad as ours and still can move the ball. Zach was not the problem, that was shown today, so it comes down to saleh or Hackett, in my opinion, fire them both for this inexcusably historically bad offense
    You know if every offensive lineman would play at to their standard of what they could be then Zach wouldn't have such a hard time getting plays off the ground and making things go if everybody would play to their potential but I don't know if they don't do something pretty soon selah will be the one to be gone.. this offense team can choose to grow together get strong or they csn keep being wimps... Each and every team member can grow and do better with something each and every team member needs to evaluate their self and not like or blame another team member for anything they need to see what they can do to make their team stronger and then they need to have a group meeting and then they need to tell her each other hey if I do this better than I know that can help you and maybe that next person says you know what maybe if I do this better it'll help you and people need to start reflecting on yourself they need to be their worst critic
    Thank you jets, thankful for you all hope you have a wonderful holiday season, phins up baby
    If Zach played the Jets would have won. He would have thrown five touchdowns with 500 yards. And ran for a 100.
    FIRE SALEH!!!!!!!!!
    healthy scratches look like a massive error in FA & draft. ZW, AL, & CL all set to take over 1$10m in '24, I think they fire JD and a new GM will make a new staff though bad owners are slow to adjust. he basically cut AL in the middle of this contract (4/44 or 2/22) in the presser.
    I agree the problem is Robert Saleh. He does not know what he is doing. We need to fire him.
    Rodger’s has this whole team by the balls it’s actually SAD!!
    Saleh is powerless against the Rodgers regime
    I am a Giants fan but I want to see the Jets win, but they need to fire this coach!
    Hey salah you set a record today, worst offense in 50 years of the N.F.L!
    The 99 Yard INT Return For TD Right Before The Half Was an EMBARRASSMENT!!!
    All these personal fouls are on the coach who continues to let them happen. Two on a team captain in one game? The only thing more disgusting than the product on the field is the asbestos- in -talcum -powder owner, who’s profited handsomely by causing tens of thousands of people to die of horrible cancers. I’m shocked “woody” isn’t in jail, never mind be allowed to own the team. Hard to be a fan since he bought the team.
    Been a fan of this team since 1990 and this team im convinced will never get close to a championship in my lifetime and im not even 40 yet... A complete disgrace from top to bottom. Everything blew up in their faces and all must be fired and a complete rebuild #FireJoeDouglas #FireRobertSaleh NOW
    Get real coaching . Get real players ! Starting at the QB POSITION!
    Saleh sounds like the jets won… crazy
    Robert saleh needs to be more Frank about this and showing frustration and fire Penalties and drops are a reflection on coaches not holding players accountable in practice . Simple
    Reporter: "Why aren't you open to changing the play caller?" Saleh: "Because Aaron wouldn't like that. And I am afraid Aaron will leave and I will get fired."
    This guy is 15 and 29 time to go!!!
    The defense plays hard until it doesn't, then it self-destructs and commits penalties. There is not a lot to prevent the Fail Mary, although I am sure it can be practiced. But the fact that we don't see you, Robert Saleh, confronting your defense after they self-destructed LAST WEEK (penalties weak effort second half), which led to THIS WEEK (penalties, weak effort 2nd half) tells us that you are too beaten down to coach the team. That's too bad, but it has happened. Muster up some coach in you and tell everyone THAT YOU LOOKED AT THE FILM AGAIN AND DECIDED THAT THE DEFENSE HAS PLAYED LIKE CRAP THE LAST TWO WEEKS IN THE SECOND HALF.
    He basically said the season over without saying it over 🤦🏾‍♂️ just pull all the guys to get healthy for next year bruh
    Siemians not the greatest but he’s had 4TD and +300 yard games
    These players all have to be on the same page to fight for the one team... It's not 100% the coaches fault they need to bring somebody in to teach these guys how to tackle, I'm not giving up on the Jets I'm hopeful they can get a coaching staff around Saleh and start teaching these guys how to make tackles, we need an offense line to protect the QB and make better blocks for running backs..ay e Selah should get a offense coordinator that can teach these guys how to block. Maybe every time these guys miss obvious tackles maybe there should be some kind of reprimand. If these guys that are on the offensive line really commit to doing the job that needs to be done we've got one of the best powerful teams around but they've just not committed to step up and be that offensive team
    This guy is sugar coating this train wreck!
    Zach Wilson needs to play
    Can we please trade our next twenty 1st round picks for Andy Reid?
    It's trash having our hopes high and they get squashed so quick ✈️
    Damn, it’s got to be tough to be a Jets fan
    Serious question for serious Jets fans: Who gives the Jets the best chance to win the next game, Zach or Tim?
    Blew your wad getting that big win for Saint Nate in Denver 😂😂😂
    Teams always wait till they play the Jets to make history
    Incompetent organizations make incompetent decisions For an organization to go this long with losing seasons - the stink belongs to the owner and work it's way down
    So one can now agree with Sean Payton about how Hackett lacks an offensive mind! After all, Payton was right! Hackett is making the Jets a joke!
    Why did I ever believe this team could be a championship contender? Even with Aaron they will be the same old Jets,
    Is Saleh still taking receipts
    Simply a big disappointment, Amazon will never again give the Jets such a platform for such a bad game..and the head coach doesn't do anything..even when the players fight..he just looks away..what a shame..it's about time he goes!
    2:40 Time Stamp says it all.... Almost like the Diva's talking through Saleh's body.... Funny as Phuck!!
    Every week Saleh just says everyone needs to do better. No kidding. What exactly does he do? He has a great DC who will be a head coach somewhere else next year. He doesn't touch anything on offense and outsources to Hackett. So why is he head coach? His record speaks for itself
    All gas no brake, right Robert? Just like you insisted how the team looked great in practice and "had the juice going."
    This is what happens when u let a player dictate your franchise... this coaching staff is a joke
    Can't any of you see? Saleh is being used as the mouthpiece. Someone(s) else are making decisions about Hackett (Rodgers), the bad o-line (Douglas), no back-up QB (Douglas/Rodgers), bad receivers (Rodgers put his guys in)
    This coach's records as Jets HC is super embarrassing 15-30 in 3 seasons with top draft picks every season and somehow its always QB's faults. Look at other outstanding coaches who turned a bad team around on 1st year with rookies. It's about time he is fired
    Its the johnsons! The johnsons say go get aaron, the johnsons say go get cobb and lazard and hackett, the johnsons say "how would it look if we removed playcalling from Hackett? Rodgers wont come back if we remove or demote Hackett!" How many coaches will continue sacrifice having work for having actual control. Every question Saleh has about the playcaller or QB makes him picture the Johnsons and what their answer is. Fire the Johnsons!
    Y’all can’t blame the coach as y’all’s team season was done in week one. That said, assuming Rodgers didn’t get hurt Tua still whips New York Fly Boys ass. 💯
    Saleh will keep “diggin” by more losses…
    Saleh us losing the locker room by having such a undisciplined offense in every phase we need a revamp of the offense this is more ON Hackett than the QB
    wonder how many years its gonna take too figure things out?
    Year and a half. So that tells you Rogers will give us next season, and that is it. Just clean house now, and don't let the door hit Rogers in the ass on the way out.
    I like Saleh and Jd think they get one more season to turn the ship around in terms of discipline and accountability from players. Lack of creativity and offensive scheming is always showing up in the game. Also with lack of offensive line depth and skill is JDs fault. They must rebuild the O line thru trades/free agency. Stop blaming Zach Wilson for 2023. He not the solution but he’s also not top 5 problems for jets
    He's got one more year tops.
    A stubborn coach amd gm is to blame for all of this who would have thought the Gase years were more successful with a less talented team, a complete embarrassment but hey as long as Woody gets his payments for season tickets he doesnt care no one will get fired and we will do all of this again mext year, same ole jets!
    he said it again lol godd fire this man
    You can change the QB But at some point it is the HC & GM. GM 4/5 years terrible. This is what he built HC 3 years terrible record. His teams have shown no progress. Everyone jokes on the Raiders. They at least realized they had to make a change.
    They should literally draft olinemen the entire 24 draft maybe sprinkle a mid rd QB in there
    Everyone is doing their best? Their best hasn’t been the best-obviously!
    Why not let Aaron Rodgers head coach this season?
    Blows my mind teams keep picking up boyle?!?
    Here’s a thought - press conferences have the coaches hooked up to a lie detector so we can watch on-screen the readings as they answer questions.
    This game looked great when they drew it up preseason. Aaron Rogers would have his Jets nipping at the Fish. But Rogers went down after 4 plays and this Black Friday game was a POS. The Jets are full of loser QBs. For the Jets players, there is nothing left except not getting hurt in the final games.
    He has to go or I’m done being a Jet fan! Sick of this guy BS!
    Cmon Zach woulda thrown that Hail Mary out of the end zone!
    It was never Zach’s fault
    Certain players must demand trades and get far away from this horrible team!
    Fn fire this guy, jezz been saying this all season!!!
    Rodgers is running this team now.
    Get an offensive head coach. Really simple. Look around the league.
    Why did we HAVE to throw the Hail Mary? We could have kneeled and ended the half.
    Saleh has given up hope for this team. Poor guy looks absolutely duhhfeeated!!
    No matter how hard they tried, the former Packers couldn't pull off a win. Go figure? I hope they like their new locker rooms.`,

    contents: `The biggest problem with the NY Jets is the simple fact that JD spent no time on building this offensive line and allowing Rodgers to be the defacto GM. This organization will never win and it’s embarrassing that I have been of fan of this team since 1997.
    My favorite Saleh quote “that’s a good question”
    Zach may actually have a decent career... somewhere else under better leadership
    Tank the season we’re going in the right direction.
    EMBARRASSMENT. How do we look so bad week after week. That’s on the coaches for sure
    If this team just scored 19 points every game, jets would be 8-4. Unreal how bad this offense is. I'd like to think rodgers would fix alot of this but idk anymore.
    It's clear Zach was just a scapegoat
    How is it that we are 4-8 now it's so clear that Zach was 2 percent of the problem but Nathaniel Hackett is 98 percent of the problem because he is not doing anything to help this team out and I think Robert Saleh means well but not all falut should fall on his shoulders. Robert Saleh is going to need a hell of a win or a miracle to the team and the why they think around they are so far gone they need something to pull them back
    Didn’t he say in hard knocks: “we don’t want to be the team that PLAYS HARD, we wanna be the team that knocks you in the f’n mouth” ... my oh my how this season has unfolded
    Shame on Saleh for starting Boyle. Zach is clearly the best QB on this roster. We basically forfeited.
    So happy Saleh continues to be predictable. Just won a bet that Saleh would bring up the All-22. With that said Hackett is the biggest problem, not the QB’s.
    Bills fired OC and had decent offense. Pitt fired OC and had a winning record. Hackett blew last season and jets shut broncos down. And now Hackett blows this season. Really blows
    This is a terribly run organization.
    Saleh patting players on the head, good job, after we just lost another season -- while fans are pulling their hair and eyes out with this unwatchable but we have to watch as fans, holding on to whatever bit of false hope, sums up another terribly coached season. Putting Simien in 4 games too late down in the 4th quarter in cold rain exemplifies failure. Fans knew 6 weeks ago that proper QB changes needed to be made, but the soft approach in a hard city crumbled like it always does and always will.
    Can't run, can't pass, can't win.
    Saleh was right in what he previously said that "Zach gives the Jets the best chance to win"... Boyle & Seimian have to be the worst QBs in the NFL... 4 fumbles in 1 quarter were pathetic^^
    I like the coat bro . That hard play fake looked beautiful with the jumbo package Olineman as a TE but once I saw Boyle made the throw uptop instead of the TE in stride underneath and the int happened I was like wow there was the game.
    I miss Zach Wilson
    Pretty laughable how people blamed Zach for all the teams problems, Looks like an Organizational issue
    He still can’t answer one question about the offense - it’s always the tape the tape…
    Should have never of hired Hackett. His greatest run as OC was in GB and he didn’t call the offensive plays in GB. That should have let you know everything you need to know about Hackett. Last year he stunk in Denver now this dumpster fire offense. I don’t know how he has another NFL job after his last two seasons
    Joe Douglas blew the QB room like ive never seen before and this offensive staff is the worse ive ever seen in 40 years of watching the NFL
    This guy is a defensive coordinator not a head coach
    It seems clear that the offensive play calling is the principle issue.
    So much for hard knocks
    as long as Rodgers is here hackett is not going anywhere the issue Salah needs to make people accountable. he doesn't
    How can the Jets be cursed like this
    He's gotta go, right? Douglas too
    It doesn't matter how hard they play they're not winning
    He's getting more chances than Zach! Put Zach back in and let them live or die together!
    Salehs team scores 8 points and he blames the refs, he’s the biggest embarrassment in the organization
    What a fiasco the Jets are!! Now it's reported that Zach Wilson doesn't want to play against the Texans next week (as Boyle and Seimans were terrible against the Falcons). Maybe Saleh can play QB? he sure can't be any worse than the trio of losers he has now
    Pitchers n Catchers time
    i am at a loss for words with this team. i look around the league at teams that can move the ball. Mekhi Becton let’s face it is another bust. gets beat repeatedly. Breece Hall will grow tired of 15 yards a game with this shitty oline. at this point, lose every game and get the best pick you can. Draft a QB to watch Rodgers for the big one year he will stay. He’s got the team by the balls so expect this same shitty coach and offensive coordinator next year.Team is a joke. if i was on defense id be laughing during the game at what this offense does.
    Its as if this team has not even practice they are of sink. Something isn't right. That's why I said the jets would have been much better as in season hard knocks to see what's really good!
    The only one that scores is the kicker Greg Zuerlien
    Is Joe Douglas still hugging players at the tunnel?
    Find a way?? When? Season is over
    The entire offense has hexaphobia. Hmmm.. Is that an oxymoron?🤔
    Broken record of 1 liners!
    No balls Saleh! And I thought Gase was bad?? 🤦‍♂️I’d take him back to be honest! Saleh just can’t coach this team! Or perhaps any team! Dreadful stuff
    some serious pruning of the roster upcoming in the off-season, and the staff, front office aren’t going anywhere because Aaron is running the show… must keep that petulant child happy even if it means destroying a promising young roster. We replaced legit depth with his buddies, and Hackett dear Christ…
    Again and again can't blame anyone except the coaches....bench Zach bring in Boyle bench him bring in Trevor....The O-Line is in shambles no matter who you have at the helm the O-Line stinks...Rodgers was in for four plays and what the O-Line didn't do there jobs out for the season....
    I honestly feel bad for Salah. He is a solid coach. His defense has shown up time and time again despite the hopeless feeling from the offense. His hands may be tied in regards to Hackett. But this game might give Salah the argument to push Hacket out. I think Roger's needs to make a compromise with the team. He can come back this year and get smacked around for his legacy if we can replace the OC
    D-E-F-E-A-T-E-D
    This team is at an ALL TIME LOW, which believe me, is CRAZY to say.
    Im sorry but did i just hear Saleh blame our offensive problems on the cadence? After 35 years as a fan i think that has to be the most creative excuse ever 😂 Our problems lay with Saleh not allowed to run the team how he sees fit thanks to an over powering stubborn GM who is to blame for this circus. This current staff and owner cant get the job done end of story. We will always be losers.
    Fire Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh as a matter of fact fire everyone in that building and start over again. We need to get to build a winning team and culture here this is so beyond bad...
    Hall and Wilson should demand to be traded off this joke of a team!
    At least zach got us some dam field goals. Fuck we doin rn
    I just ha e one question for you Jets fans. How does this team allow Zach Wilson to Start through 11 games and completely fail at every statistical category just lime last year. After benching him, you play 2 QBs in 2 weeks? Zach did this. Shouldve cut him after signing Rogers.
    Saleh needs to fire Hackett or hes going destroy the little credit hes got left
    No, this one is most definitely on the OTHER QBs! The coaches don't throw the ball. It would be nice though if the coaches didn't teach these Jets players to play harder but play SMARTER! Lack of execution AND IQ is telling on this poor excuse of a team. And you still have guys celebrating first downs in this game knowing that they're pretty much OUT of playoff contention. Just friggin DUMB!!!!
    How did they beat the bills and eagles and lose 5 straight? Coaching and playcallings how
    Woody, sell the team.
    Zach scapegoat lol
    Only swapped QB today to shut everyone up… They’ll start Zach next wk. Can’t run the ball with no O line. Can’t get passes off with no O line. Coaches aren’t going anywhere and they’ll mulligan this season… I’d take Rodgers in a boot back there right now
    PLAYOFFS?!!!- Are these reporters delusional and clueless ? If I was Coach Salas I’d refuse talking to these idiots already ... It’s OVER. Since Opening night !
    Cut somebody and go beg Strevler to come back at this point lol
    Saleh is not head coach material
    Always trying to find ways. Forever lost
    Sound like the same respond week after week… it’s time for a change, get rid of Saleh
    Time to clean the whole house. again.
    Fire Hackett
    Every week don’t score and penalties,They just lost and he fist bumps Breece wtf ,He just wants to be liked ,will never get in players faces so they don’t care about penalties,Take the under when they play the Pats 😂
    Fire everyone, sell the team.
    How Long does The Ownership Keep Listening To Saleh say: We Got to Work on that, Basic Football ?? Great Question !! All I Here from Him. He’s over his Head Woody, Are You Blind. Your Losing Fans EVERY GAME THEY LOSE. HE’S 14 Ws AND 28 Losses for three [3] Years now, I see no  NO CHANGES ? This Keeps Up, The Media And Fans will want You to RENAME THE TEAM, THE NEW JERSEY JETS, NEW YORK IS EMBARRASSED!!
    Someone give him the foam red nose
    Hey WOODY, 14 Wins And 28 Looses since you hired this Chump in 2020.?? They are Terrible from the Top Down. By the way, Anybody see the GM Lately?
    Bad HC Bad GM Bad owner wow
    Worst coach in N.F.L along with a grade school offense!
    START ZACH‼️‼️‼️‼️
    Why these reporters ask about the oline
    Need to be coached. Joe Douglas was. O.L. guy. Thinking he knew makeup of good O.L. TERRIBLE 3 YRS NOW SAME SHIT ! Watch other teams with backup QB score pts
    Fire this guy, I have seen enough, take Douglas with him, neither know anything about offense, or how to hire someone who does actually know, too many poor choices all around...Time for accountability.
    3 wasted years plus for the New York Football Jets....
    #FireEverybody
    Only cates about his Def and truly os not. HC
    Dead man walking
    Bye bye coach Saleh. Never gonna be a head coach again. Every week is the same with the same losing results. Can't just manage the defense and not be held accountable for horrible offense. The record speaks for itself.
    This coach is a joke from day one. Needs to go.
    All he saus is thats a fair question. Woody raise the tix prices some more for this crap you put on rhe field.
    I hate to say this but.....He needs to be fired
    Saleh looks and sounds like a guy who is way over his head and should be fired
    Comical.
    Saleh is not a head coach. Not decisive with personnel. Hackett should be gone. Should be back as a DC. Thats his strength.
    Joke of a GM and organization. I want utter embarrassment for this team.
    Zach > simean
    Salah, Lack of Intensity, Lack of passion during Press Conferences, Lack of wanting to Win..... Your Fired!!!! You are a Flop!!!!
    This guy doesn't know how to run an offense. Just fire him
    Sounds like a broken record 😢. Been a jet fan since 1966. This team is unwatchable. So boring . No mojo.
    Stoppppppppppppppppp!
    You guys are the laughing stock of the NFL A good 60% of the players will not be wearing the Jets uniform next year they will be leaving...
    Yo
    No
    This guy is all platitudes and corny mantras, all surface no substance

    Zack should play with a chip on his shoulder more often. He can make all the throws. No question this young man has all the talent he needs. Great to see that talent on display today.
    The Jets promised to trade him in the off season. That was huge in this game today. With the shackles of this franchise off of his shoulders he balled out. He looked like he felt no fear of failure. Wasn't worried about the hook. Didn't care what the media or fans thought and just played ball. Played free. No expectations, no pressure, no problem. I think this confirms it for us. The weight of being the savior of this organization, even with Rodgers here, was too much for the kid. It was always too much for him. Seeing how he played knowing he's out the door confirms it for me. QB1 for the NYJ isn't a joke.
    The Tim Boyle experience was a tremendous waste of everybody's time.
    There We Go!! Zack, tight End play, Sauce (stopping that run in the 2nd) Reed, G. Willson, B. HALL, X Gipson. THEY ALL BALLED OUT!! GREAT WIN! LOOKED EXCELLENT! Dalvin was on the wrong side/broken play on that fumble, but other than that great game👍🏾👍🏾 i Love it.
    Zach is improving. Keep him.
    Finally! The Jets offensive coordinators did an outstanding job!
    This team has screwed over Zach so bad.
    Finally looking like a 2nd overall pick.
    He played great with the same roster he’s had al year. Maybe this proves if we get good Qb play we are a completely different team. Let’s see if he can actually have 2 good games in a row
    Congratz coach! Great unexpected dominant win. ✈️
    Great win on the road against Houston. Now, we gotta win again at Miami. It can be done. Let's go !
    Time to move on next season, Zach. Somewhere that understands football and that you can get the training you need to move ahead. Don’t get injured…
    D looked good as theyve all season, zach played well today, but lets see him do it a couple weeks in a row.
    Talk about 2.0 this time last season, white came in and straight up balled. Crazy that history repeated itself through Wilson's redemption!
    Keep on rolling. Let's go jets.
    LFG Z!!!! WAY TO GO BUD!! GREAT GAME!!
    Let Zach throw. they finally called a game for his skill set and look what happens...
    Ok let’s see how he continues to plays next 4 games left
    The ball placement on Zacks throws were elite, the O Line is the problem not him. How has he supposed to have built confidence when getting sacked so often as a new young player. Hopefully moving forward the O line gets better so he can build even more confidence.
    Zach silenced all the doubters
    Should have happened 24 games ago. Ownership needs to own up.
    Didn’t they say they’re unloading Zach after the season? Wonder if that letter was already mailed. 🤔 Of course he’s going to light it up anywhere else. Look at Flacco. Never saw him do any of that wearing green.
    They wrote me off, I ain't write back - Zach Wilson
    Apparently Hackett was in the booth today and saw how to attack the defense. Something to try out to finish out the season
    I just hope they don’t do something silly & trade him. Open up the playbook & block for once
    Zach might have earned himself a backup job somewhere else next season. Nice to see him not totally blow for a change.
    This coaches bone head decision to play yo-yo with Zach again the last two games is going to cost the jets a playoff birth this year. I am shocked Zach has played this well for this dysfunctional organization.
    Zach is a good player.
    Who's that awesome tight end? Great play and great blocking.
    Hey guys I'm just glad they won...a little to late yes.but it looked good
    If Zach played last week the Jets would've won and we would still be in the playoff hunt.
    Zach Wilson is elite!
    Zack looked great, but he's teased us like this before, only to be let down the following week.
    I believe that Zac is their franchise QB, that said however, they need better OL and quality Wide Outs. But believe the Jets need to work the middle more, and more or less turn Zac lose.
    Zach the man now but soon as he loss a game his the problem and the bad guy…😢😂he’s not the problem….
    Remember when coach said Zach plays the best when he plays free and like Zach…. Well why did you and the coaching staff not let him????? You guys tried to make him into a game manager and glued that in his mind and to never turn the ball over…. When that is not is game and he is a gun slinger…. You guys basically admitted you hurt him just by that comment alone and it’s been obvious anyway.. played safe and for field goals… u guys better let Zach play agressive and the way he is suppose to the rest of the year…. Since u guys already ruined the season and zach
    Zach deserves better coaching.
    Jets need to just let Zach sling it every single week hes at his best when he is throwing, and I don't mean check downs I mean legit passes that are further than 10 yards.
    Good job Zach, well done
    So what team will take him in next season? And what is Jets price … will they just release him? Everyone was screaming that his days in New York is finished. And strange he had success when OL looked “almost” good for once 😊 perhaps a successful OL would be useful in NFL 🤔 someone should take notes 📝
    Know we got to win out and get some help. But we need crush Miami. Please go jets
    If he didn’t took Wilson out last 4 games Jets would be 7-8. You cant win all, this a season where even the good teams are not performing they best.
    Saleh is over his head as a HC. Cant handle poigmant questions without nervous laughter, CMON. We need a real head coach that teaches and holds players accountable. Robert Saleh is a good coordinator, but is a yes man. Yes men dont make successful head coaches in the NFL
    calling it now jets/pats game is for final draft spots "top 5 pick" bill gives us the win being 1 pick ahead and landing next future qb or next top future star for years. even when we win we lose, always remember that "im just having wilson/lawrence flashbacks and last years draft how he screwed us the last o-lineman by trading to pittsburg"
    Good job Zach 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
    Defence once again stoke!
    Is Zach still on pace to win MVP this year? 😎😂😂
    Zach provided CJ a free QB tutoring today
    It woulda been 12-10 if I was running the Texans offense.. Smh.. I don’t who woulda won, and there still would 20 punts.. But yeah, Ida been under center all day and running it 80% of the time.. Smh.. Those PFF guys never factored in rain, apparently?..
    If the Jets trade or release Zach, they are fucking incompetent. Flacco tearing shit up on the Browns today, I wonder why. Good coaching makes all the difference
    Let's be clear, this win had nothing to do with Saleh. Saleh still is a very bad head coach. This was all Zach he just balled out because he has nothing to lose.
    Not one update on McGovern since he went down. Guess he’s out for the season. No clue
    Is anyone gonna talk about the rumor of getting rid of Zach in the offseason?
    😂😂😂😂GOOOOOOOO JETS!!! 😂😂😂
    Woody... please dont get trigger happy and fire this coaching staff or front office. Just let them draft more players on offense and the team will be fine. O-Line first then skill positions.
    All smiles rn but won’t score more than 14 points next week 😂😂😂😂😂😂
    I was screaming for Zach to play last week..we would have won dammit!!
    Zach should be telling his agent to get him the first flight out of New York after the season is over! There is a reason why nobody wants to play in that market.
    One good game doesn’t take away the last 12 games this kid started and stunk up the place
    Is the Zach Wilson trade rumor true ?😢
    And yet he still won't be a Jet next year. It's really fucked up what this team has done to this kid.
    It's easy to play w no pressure lol
    You deserve to be fired for benching our best QB besides Rodgers in back to back seasons. You embarrassed this young man and you owe HIM!
    Good game but you still have a losing season!
    Fire Saleh& keep Hackett, I guess. Next week could be a disaster.
    It was only a good game because the Texans defense did not show up to play today. There was such a lack of pressure, it makes zach look good
    Saleh 🦨 stinks as a head coach, since he was hired 3 seasons ago. Facts!
    There goes a top five pick for one more win Whoopi do. As soon as Rogers went down, I hoped the Jets were going to go 0-16 to draft a QB. Zack Wilson’s best game and I would still cut him at the end of the year!
    Not be a hater but man , please don’t regress next week please Zach ….
    📣J.E.T.S JETS JETS JETS!!! 🛩️..
    Jets stadium is cursed.
    Why dont you him criedt. ❤
    Hate to say it but we gotta sit Max Mitchell?
    A little to late 🤷‍♂️
    Sticky back end
    Did the light bulb just go on?
    Movie is the News.
    This 🤡 ruined Zach!!
    Saleh is just not head coach material and should be fired along with Joe Douglas. Wilson had 1 good game but nothing else move on. Same old Jets
    It's time to get BOTH wilsons out of the green pit of toxic waste known as the Jets.
    His head is so shiny
    Ok Rob your great coach we know all gas your horrible your offense is horrible good luck winning your super bowl
    zAcH iS bACk
    Hey Salah there's other players besides zack a poo who won this game!
    Zach still fumbled because of a bone head play.
    Yes, he believes in Zach so much, and that is why he benched him. This guy is a terrible coach...`,

    contents: `I find it so strange that after almost 3 years the media and fan base are realizing that Zach isn’t the primary problem with this team. The construction of the offense has been fatally flawed this whole time
    Please let Zach go to a good team with a strong O-line.
    Wow.. just WOW!! Saleh and JD gotta go.
    "Credit to them" " we fought hard" " they did their best" ..making Rich Kotite look good
    52 years of watching this franchise. This could be the most disappointing season ever.
    Absolute disaster of a coaching job. But at least Saleh was smiling on the sideline when we were down 27 - 0 as fans were furious again BUT these coaches have no emotional attachment to the team like fans do. Rodgers and Garrett show more emotion but Saleh and Joe D... all is good 🤬
    This was a massacre from beginning to end. Its official, let "Tank Watch Season" begin.   Jets are sitting comfortably in the 6th overall spot right now.
    O-line was disgusting. Really bad today, really bad. Can't even evaluate the play because they were so bad. And they weren't that good against Texans.
    Credit to the other team. They exposed how terrible we are.
    Blaming it on the OL, using them as a scapegoat. Great coach
    0:00: 🏈 The team struggled with offensive performance and faced challenges with player health. 2:27: 🏈 The post-game interview discusses the team's performance and facing adversity during the game. 4:04: 🏈 Discussion about a football player's competitive spirit, teammate qualities, and concerns about his performance and involvement in the team. Recapped using Tammy AI
    Imagine Saleh gave a brutally honest assessment of himself and the Dolphins game? It would sound like this: " I think the team quit on me. Or, they just don't respond to me. I'm probably the problem. I don't see my coaching abilities as part of the solution, that's for sure. If i'm not fired, I will resign. I need to put the team first.And the fans"
    Poor guy. Takes guts to stand up there. Hope the jets figure this out
    This coaching staff is potentially the worst we've ever had. Im so excited for no one to get fired and the jets to draft another edge rusher rd1 to ride the bench
    I said it last week& I'll say it again, questioned the hiring of Saleh 3 seasons ago& should be fired. A record of 17-48, let's get real Jets fans. Life-long Jets fan from Oklahoma, where's Rex Ryan when you need em' ?
    If Zach had any other offense he would be one of the best players in the league currently
    The Sad thing the crazy owners said the whole staff will be back next season,if I’m Aaron Rodgers I’m not coming back here I’m retiring
    They fought their tails off. I remember Hue Jackson would say that too after every game
    Make Ulbrich the head coach and bring in a new OC next year, defense has played hard for him, I would hate to lose him to another team and get stuck with Saleh.
    Don’t worry Jets fans, we will win the offseason again! The only thing we do win!
    The only thing this guy ever says is ...We have to be better...Every week...every game...
    There are so many things to state and complain about.., but Hopefully they play like a football team that plays fundamentally sound football next week. What happened today is a F- for the entire team especially the coaching part Ciao!
    How is the first round draft pick going from last year? when 8 billion people knew they needed O line
    The media was calling for Staley to be fired after losing a playoff game last year and yet those same media outlets defend Saleh every time.
    I know nobody likes to hear it, but this is for the best... Let's get the highest 1st rounder we can get, let's draft nothing but O-Line, let's sign the best O-Lineman we can in Free Agency, and let's make some hard trades for good offensive lineman, even trade Huff if we have to. We have one main thing to concentrate on in the offseason OFFENSIVE LINE, let's do that and sign Mike Evans and get ready for a Superbowl run in just 8 months... GO JETS.
    JD and Saleh don’t know how to develop an offense. It’s been like that for the last 3 years.
    Tomlinson and Becton need to be shown the door. They didn’t fight today at all.
    Here's the way this should have gone: Press: Coach, why is your O line so horrible? Coach: Well, because we used our draft picks on even more defensive players even though we are already so deep on defense. It never occurred to me that we might actually need some guys on the O line to protect our HOF qb and block for our running backs Press: Sounds like you're not the smartest front office Coach: Sure, it's easy to look at it now and say that, but who knew you needed an offensive line before now? Press: Everyone Coach: Really? That doesn't sound right.
    “they fought their tails off” so hard for an “0”
    Seems like the team regressed this year. Bottom line - the offense couldn't score at all. Seems like last year they could at least score a couple field goals. The o-Line needs help
    You can tell Robert is despondent and the fight seems to be out of him.
    This presser is just a repeat from day one.He and JD have to go, and take Rogers with them.
    That defensive guy shouldn’t have mocked waddle after that sack. You know it was personal at that point. Finsup 🐬
    Saleh is not going anywhere unless Rodgers gives his approval. Good luck Giants fans!
    1:13 he says "they fought their tails off, I thought they played hard". Translation, my team still was trying, so please don't compare me to Brandon Staley for a team that quit on me. Even though Brandon Staley was hired at the same time as Saleh, and got fired with a .500 winning percentage, and Saleh isn't worried about his job with a .333 winning %, and possibly his third straight 10 loss season. In a word, Saleh.....you stink.
    I feel for this man he towed the company line he came out week after week and took the hits he’s clearly not allowed to make decisions on this team because clearly this the New York Aaron Rodgers and thus Joe Douglas did whatever Rodgers wanted and that was hire all his friends .. quite frankly I feel the media also played a hand in this teams downfall when it keep calling Rodgers a players coach undermining Robert’s voice
    “Like I said” - Robert Saleh
    Looks like a defeated man up there. Reminds me alot of Herm Edwards when he lost the team.
    He's A motionless Eeyore!!!
    Seems like Mekhi Becton was setting Zach up the way he blatantly allowed him to get sacked over and over please !!
    Basically, it’s called Out- Planned & Out-Coached ! It’s OVER! * Everyone knows the Dolphins throw quick short passes and the Jets “D” was nowhere to be found... is that their idea of the Twilight Zone D ? *Besides that ..... This Jets offense Couldn’t score on Alabama, Michigan or Georgia 😳
    30-0 / 5-9 / 16-32 / 5-12 💚
    This was definitely a strange interview. This Jets team is spiraling out of control
    Same as last season! Fire him please!!!!!
    Get them next week. Go jets.
    Jd saleh and Zach all need to be shown the door this offseason. Jets are a clown show
    The biggest indicator he has lost it was 4th and 4 on our 41 smh he should be ashamed of that decision smh
    Joe douglas. Better add offensive lineman with 1st 2 picks
    "It won't snowball" - Salah...his guy is in over his head.
    Well at least you always win the off-season
    As a very long time fan after that shit show yesterday, I am at the resignation stage. This team just stinks. The defense isn’t what people think it is. And It has been exposed. Forget the offense lmao. The only thing that never changes is the owner! And he sticks his nose in and ruins it all the time.
    No Saleh YOU DONT NEED TO BE BETTER , YOU AND THE OTHER COACHES NEED TO GO thats what you need!
    A competent organization would have already fired Saleh so we wouldn't have to listen to these pathetic press conferences. This coach is putting players in harm's way with his inability to prepare the offense, and Hackett is completely exposed as a terrible OC. Matt Lafleur called the plays in Greenbay; just look at AR8 shaking his head on the sidelines every time a play is called.
    As a 49ers fan who used to love Saleh, I must say he is an absolutely horrendous head coach and I am amazed he has not been fired yet
    Ask him if he thinks his team was prepared
    Send Zach to rams and get picks lol
    at least saleh ran the steps before the game
    If you have any dignity you would fire your staff and then resign!!
    Dam JD, what are you gonna do for next season?
    "Coach, shouldn't you resign?"
    Some coaches are better at being coordinators like Todd Bowels great D Coordinator but horrible head coach
    Need to do better? You didn't score a point in the whole game. Last week was a fluke. This week is who the Jets really are
    He sucks as a head coach& especially press conferences. Fix the O-line in the off season and fire Saleh now.
    Aaron rogers faked his injury..... This team is criminal
    Every player on that O line sucks. Bechton got beat for 3 sacks. Dont re sign him. Terrible
    THIS TEAM IS TERRIBLE THANKS FOR RUINING MY LOVE FOR FOOTBALL
    I don't buy the story about the head injury, At first it was dehydration, Us Truthers don't appreciate our boy getting sidelined
    Are The Jets and "Good Football" in the same sentence??😮
    Where is the accountability? Offensive heads need to roll
    O-Line is pathetic, big 300 lb guys dumb to not know how to block by now.Zach Wilson is not the blame for these "pro" weak linemen..Saleh has no balls to get after the linemen.throw them in the weight room
    Q: Why must I keep being faithful to this franchise?...just why??? They can't even give me a decent game to watch... even with a loss all we want to see is a good game of talented players who we invest money and time. The least they can do is show up...oline smh horrible disgusting smh OC needs to be the first out the door.smh
    Too busy trying to embarrass Quarterbacks and embarrassed himself.
    The Jets don’t know how to develop a QB never Definitely not this staff
    CLUELESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    He told everyone he is keeping receipts 😅When can we return are receipts for anew coach and not a statue
    Story is the Movie 1 Minute.
    I’m done with this coach. Let’s lick our wounds and move on. This whole “we need to be better” excuse has gotten old. What we need is a better coaching staff with the exception of the Defensive Coordinator
    Put a fork in Saleh, he’s cooked. Dudes a broken record up there. Sounds like he’s scared to answer questions
    Football Gods: I (we) will never let the Jests win anything!!! Not as long as I'm alive!!! And at last check, I believe I will live forever!! Sorry Jet nation!! Boohoo.
    I think this may be the worst coaching staff the Jets have had in years. Seems like Saleh doesnt give a shit anymore
    what happened to wilson/wilson?! does zach even see garri?
    This joker has to go, it’s obvious they quit on him
    Was he watching the game today!Fought hard,are you kidding me.Saleh is clueless and needs to be held accountable along with all the coaches accept the defensive coordinator. Clean house!I have no faith with tbis coacing staff next year, even with Rodgers.
    Think the NFL just wants to sell jerseys?
    We have been beaten up all season the oline dont seem to care the players only meeting earlier in the season must of been to say lets stop trying as we are still going to be paid any way is offence has to change wasting a top tier defence someone of the oline needs to step up and be the mauler that stands up and says lets get the ball moving by running behind me. The drawing board they keep going back to need to be wiped and start again give hacket his p45 see you later woody its on you for letting this happen to the team you have let your fans down again
    I would fire the OC yesterday.
    Week to week we lose.
    Somehow his press conference was even worse than the game!
    Time to tank and clean house. Or sell the team Woody!!
    Should get “we need to be better” tattooed on his forehead
    Salah gotta go 🤷‍♂️
    How about them jets?! Zach Wilson generational talent what a joke!!! 😂
    Everybody’s got a plan……until they get punched in the mouth
    Great def. coor, Poor head coach..
    It’s not Saleh fault.
    Lots of coaches need to be fired.
    Gotta look at the FILM LOL
    Fire him
    WHY ISNT KEITH CATER FIRED YET???? TITANS PLAYERS WERE HAPPY WHEN HE LEFT, THIS GUY CANT COUCH ARE OLINE IS WORSE. HOW CAN OTHER TEAMS HAVE GUYS COME IN AND BE SERVICEABLE, ARE GUYS LOOKS LOST EVEN ARE STARTERS. BECTON AND TOMLINSON ARE BRUTAL. R WE FUCKING SERIOUS

    Zuerlein saved Salah’s job this year by making all those FGs.
    We should keep this team together.. i want to see the finished product. #Keep Saleh
    J-E-T-S... JETS... JETS... JETS
    Saleh is a beauty! Give this man an O-line and quarterback
    There will be plenty of excitement with him as the coach next year.😂😂😂
    i hope that we keep saleh
    Love Coach Saleh. I hope that we keep him
    Is Aaron gonna be able to play next year?🏈🏈♥️♥️
    I really hope jets don't give into idiot impatient fans.. Lets complete this rebuild rather than tearing down the building and redoing everything all over
    Wild Washington throws all over the jets then runs it three times and punts wow should be investigated lol
    Love Saleh
    Please Keep Saleh and Douglas for another year. I want to see the finished product. we need an OT and OG tho in the draft.
    Am i alone on liking this guy?
    Please keep Saleh and this defense
    all you had to do was kick that 54 YARD FG away and not make it, and we could have said we competed, and secure that 4th pick. Now we just dropped all the way down to the 10th pick, for what a moral victory that will do absoultly nothing for us. We would have been in such an elite postion with the 4th pick, and be able to get back a 2nd rounder which we lost, and possibly draft joe ALT or fashanu, we just blew it. sick to my stomach right now, the one thing i was looking forward to this season was a high draft pick, so we could complete this O-line.
    What’s to like? 3 wins every 10 games for 3 years?
    I want to see Saleh as head coach next season.. All of this anti-saleh and anti-douglas retorhic was started by Sleepy Joe Beningo
    I'm convinced Saleh's beard is fake, It grows really fast lol
    No fan should be happy about this win
    where was the defense in the second half
    This team and organization is nothing more than empty slogans and Ted talks 😂😂this team struggled against the commanders just let it sink in this team is not winning the superbowl next year and if Aaron gets hurt again I’m positive everyone gets fired b4 the trade deadline next year
    My Jets...? We win the ones we should lose. We are playing for positioning in next year's draft.
    What a fucking disgrace, they lose out on the top 2 tackles. I hate this owner so so much
    Sad we can’t even enjoy a game that starts 27-7 Shitty coached team
    Why do u like this guy? As a coach I mean!
    This guy needs to go, him and Douglas!!🖕🏼
    Terrible game terrible season terrible discipline terrible coaching
    A joke of a team with the worst coaching which will be really exposed once they suck even with AR playing
    This win is a lost
    Terrible win
    The pick has to be a QB
    Fire this fool
    Tired of this coach.
    This man is NOT A HEAD COACH, but he will be back next year , same old JETS 💩🏈🤡`,
